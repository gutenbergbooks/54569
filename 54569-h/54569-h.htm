"I concluded, however unaccountable the assertion
might appear at first sight, that good-nature was an
essential quality in a satirist, and that all the sentiments
which are beautiful in this way of writing, must proceed
from that quality in the author.  Good-nature produces
a disdain of all baseness, vice, and folly; which
prompts them to express themselves with smartness
against the errors of men, without bitterness towards
their persons."&mdash;STEELE, <i>Tatler</i>, No. 242.

<p>
The year 1775, which deprived England of her
American colonies, was generous to English art
and literature.  Had it only produced Walter
Savage Landor, or even no better worthy than
James Smith of the <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, it
would not have done badly.  But these were its
added bounties.  Its greater gifts were Turner,
Charles Lamb and Jane Austen.  Could we be
offered the choice of re-possessing the United
States, or losing the very memory of these three,
which alternative would we choose?
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to appreciate the lapse of time
since Jane Austen was at work.  We are now
within a few years of the centenary of her death.
She had been laid beneath that black slab in
Winchester Cathedral before the first railway had
been planned, or the first telegraph wire stretched
from town to town, or the first steamship steered
across the Atlantic.  Yet the must of age has not
settled on her books.  The lavender may lie
between their pages, but it is still sweet, and there
is many a successful novelist of our own times
whose work is already far more out of date than
hers.
</p>

<p>
This perennial timeliness of atmosphere is no
necessity of genius.  Fielding and Scott remain
a delight for succeeding generations, because they
possess the essential quality of humanity, but the
life which they offer us is largely remote from our
own, foreign to our experience.  Jane Austen
invites us to enjoy a change of air among people
with most of whom we may soon feel at ease,
finding nothing in their conversation that will
disturb our equanimity.  If you are one of Jane
Austen's lovers, you come back to her novels for
a holiday from the noise and whirl of modern
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
fiction, as you would come from a great city to
the countryside or the coast village for rest and
restoration.
</p>

<p>
The failure of her books to attract the mass of
novel-readers is due in the first place to a lack
of "exciting" qualities.  No syndicate that knew
its business would offer them for serial purposes;
they have no breathless "situations," and their
strong appeal is to the calmer feelings and the
intellect, not to the passions and the prejudices.
In one respect only has she anything in common
with the popular novelists of our day.  Her set
of characters is even more limited than theirs.
The virtuous heroine, the handsome hero, the
frivolous coquette, the fascinating libertine, the
worldly priest, are to be encountered in her pages,
but the wicked nobleman and the criminal
adventuress find no places there.  What is often
overlooked, however, by those who speak of Jane
Austen's few characters, is that no two of them
have quite the same characteristics of mind.
They are differentiated with admirable art.  Even
so, the types are few, and the smallness of the
field which she cultivated has been frequently
adduced as a bar to her inclusion among the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
masters of English fiction.  She has the least
range of them all.  When one thinks of the host
of strongly-marked types in Scott, in Dickens,
in Thackeray, of the diversity of scenes and
incidents which fill the pages of their books, her
few squires and parsons and unemployed officers,
with their wives and daughters, who live out their
days in Georgian parlours and in shrubberies and
parks, make a poor enough show in the dramatic
and spectacular way.
</p>

<p>
No particular passion dominates the life of any
one of her leading personages.  Avarice, which
has afforded such notable figures to almost every
great novelist, in her world is only represented
by meanness; lust and hate are nowhere strongly
emphasized, even love is rarely permitted to
suggest the possibility of becoming violent.
There are no Pecksniffs, Quilps, Père Grandets,
nor Lord Steynes; no Lady Kews, Jane Eyres,
nor Lisbeth Fischers.  Only into the hearts of
her younger women does Jane Austen throw the
searchlight of complete knowledge, lit by her own
feelings, and tended with self-analysis, and her
heroines still leave a large part of virtuous
womankind unrepresented.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
</p>

<p>
Balzac, describing the origins of his play <i>La
Marâtre</i> to the manager who produced it, said:
"We are not concerned with an appalling melodrama
wherein the villain sets light to houses and
massacres the inhabitants.  No, I imagine a
drawing-room comedy where all is calm, tranquil,
pleasant.  The men play peacefully at the
whist-table, by the light of wax candles under little
green shades.  The women chat and laugh as
they do their fancy needlework.  Presently they
all take tea together.  In a word, everything
shows the influence of regular habits and harmony.
But for all that, beneath this placid surface the
passions are at work, the drama progresses until
the moment when it bursts out like the flame of
a conflagration.  That is what I want to show."
</p>

<p>
The scene described is Jane Austen's&mdash;the
quiet parlour, the card-players, the women
chatting, and working with their coloured silks, the
tea-tray, the shaded candles, the general air of
ease and tranquillity.  We find it at Mansfield
Park with the Bertrams, at Hartfield with the
Woodhouses, and, in spite of Lydia and her
"mamma," at Longbourn with the Bennets.  But
the <i>dénouement</i> to which Balzac looked for his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
effect has no attraction for Jane Austen.
Catherine Morland, at Northanger Abbey,
imagines some such tragedy smouldering into life
below the surface of quiet habitude as Balzac
discovers in his horrid war of step-daughter and
step-mother, and Jane Austen herself laughs with
Henry Tilney at this impressionable country
maiden whom he mocks while he admires.
</p>

<p>
Balzac and Jane Austen both strove to depict
life, to show the motives and instincts of men and
women as the causes of action; in his case of an
energetic and passionate type, wherein the primary
instincts are freely exercised, in her case, of a
simple, orderly kind, which allows but little scope
for the display of violence or the elaboration of
plots.  There are exceptions, of course, which for
fear of the precise critic must at least be
illustrated.  Balzac has his quiet Pierrettes and Rose
Cormons, who suffer as patiently and far more
poignantly than an Elinor Dashwood or a Fanny
Price; Jane Austen has her dissolute Willoughbys
and disturbing Henry Crawfords, and also her
Maria Rushworths and Mrs. Clays, who throw
their bonnets over the windmills with even less
regard for their reputations than a Beatrix de
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
Rochefide or a Natalie de Manerville.  When a
lapse from virtue on the part of any of her
characters was, on some rare occasion, necessary
to her plan, Jane Austen did not allow any prudish
reserve to stand in the way, but it may be said
no less unreservedly that she never introduced
vice where her story could do quite as well without
it, and it is never the central motive of her novels.
It is, then, not alone for the narrowness of
her field that her title to greatness has often been
disputed.  Many persons whose literary tastes
are marked by understanding and catholicity
refuse to acknowledge the genius of so peaceful
a novelist.  Because of the absence of passion
and sentiment in Jane Austen's works, the author
of <i>Jane Eyre</i> would not recognize in her the great
artist that Scott and Coleridge believed her to
be.  "The passions," wrote Miss Brontë, "are
perfectly unknown to her; she rejects even a
speaking acquaintance with that stormy
sisterhood.  Even to the feelings she vouchsafes no
more than an occasional graceful but distant
recognition&mdash;too frequent converse with them
would ruffle the smooth elegance of her progress."  The
three novelists here brought into momentary
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
association, the creators of <i>Eugénie Grandet</i>,
<i>Emma</i>, and <i>Jane Eyre</i> represent three distinctive
forces in fiction.  Charlotte Brontë, disillusioned
with the world, of which she knew very little, and
angry at its follies and injustices, sat alone and
poured out her feelings in her books; Balzac,
hungry for fame, wrote furiously all night by
the light of a dip, stimulating his fiery
imagination with the strong coffee which was the
irresponsible author of many of his most astonishing
chapters; Jane Austen, taking her meals and her
rest regularly, sat at her little desk in the parlour
where her mother and sister were sewing or writing
letters, and placidly turned her observations and
reflections into manuscript.  Her hazel eyes, we
may be certain, never rolled in any kind of frenzy,
her brown curls were never disturbed by the
spasmodic movements of nervous hands.  Great
artist as she was, she had no greater share of the
"artistic temperament" than many a popular
novelist who "turns out" two or three serial
stories at a time by the simple process of shuffling
the situations, changing the scenery, and re-naming
the characters.  If she had been touched by
the strong emotion of a Charlotte Brontë, or the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
burning imagination of a Balzac, she might have
produced work which would have set the world on
fire, instead of merely infusing keen happiness
into responsive minds and compelling their love
and admiration.  That is only to say that if she
had been somebody else she would not have been
herself.  It is peace, not war, that she carries to
us.  Even her irony is not of the sardonic kind,
and in her work the "master spell" is so daintily
mingled that the bitter ingredients seem to have
disappeared in the making.
</p>

<p>
Respect and admiration and sympathy in a
high degree have been given by millions of minds,
not always emotional, to many authors, but Jane
Austen is loved as few have been.  The love is
inspired by her works, and she shares it with
Elizabeth Bennet, Emma Woodhouse, and Anne
Elliot.  Milton, in a line which is as clear in
meaning as it is foggy in construction, speaks of
Eve as "the fairest of her daughters."  Jane
Austen is regarded by the generality of her lovers
as the most delightful of her own heroines, and
not merely as the woman who brought them into
existence.
</p>

<p>
Could we have loved her so much if we had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
lived with her at Steventon Rectory or at Chawton
Cottage?  What she was at home I think we
know much better from her own letters than from
her brother Henry's panegyric, which, in spite of
its obvious sincerity of intention, too nearly
resembles the memorial inscriptions of his own
period to be regarded with quite as much confidence
as respect.  "Faultless herself," he wrote,
"as nearly as human nature can be, she always
sought, in the faults of others, something to
excuse, to forgive, or forget."  "Always" is a
word which&mdash;as Captain Corcoran discovered of
its reverse&mdash;can hardly ever be used without
considerable reservations.  We know, from her
own pen, that Jane&mdash;we call one unwedded queen
"Elizabeth," why should we not call another
"Jane"?&mdash;did not "always" show so much
tenderness for the faults of others, and when we
remember the endless variety of human nature
we cannot but regard this ascription of
"faultlessness" by an affectionate brother as of little
more evidential value than Mrs. Dashwood's
opinion (in <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>) of the
"faultlessness" of Marianne's lovers.  It is no
disparagement to Henry Austen to say that his little
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
memoir is more convincing as a record of his own
character than of his sister's.  Their nephew,
Mr. Austen Leigh, who wrote the fullest and most
admirable account of Jane Austen, was still in
his teens when she died.  Apart from these sparse
reminiscences we know practically nothing about
her except from her own novels and letters, but
from them we may learn almost as much of the
mind of this delightful woman as any loving
relation could have told us.  It may be possible
for an author to write an artificial novel without
betraying his own nature to any positive extent,
but such novels as Jane Austen's cannot so be
produced; it is possible to write letters which,
apart from the penmanship, offer no evidences of
character; but a pair of devoted sisters, however
different their ability or their philosophy of life,
could not correspond during twenty years without
displaying much of the workings of their minds.
</p>

<p>
Some of Jane's literary admirers think that she
was lively and talkative, others that she was
prone to silence in company.  Probably both
views are correct.  It depended on the company.
Among those who could appreciate her fun and
her wit, her harmless quips and quizzing, she was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
full of vivacity; among those who raised their
eyebrows at her impromptu verses and missed the
points of her piquant remarks on persons and
incidents she was speedily content, within the
bounds of good manners, to observe rather than
to join in the comedy of conversation.  We need
not unreservedly believe her brother's assurance
that "she never uttered either a hasty, a silly, or
a severe expression," but we may, from all we
know of her, be fairly confident that she had
a control over her tongue which few such
gifted humourists have possessed.  As for her
temper, it was said in her family that
"Cassandra had the <i>merit</i> of having her temper always
under command, but that Jane had the <i>happiness</i>
of a temper that never required to be commanded."
</p>

<p>
That her nature was not, in any marked degree,
what is commonly called "sympathetic" we may
see from many passages in her letters, and her
novels afford ample corroboration.  There was no
avoidable hypocrisy about her.  In this at least
she is the counterpart of Elizabeth or Anne.  "Do
not be afraid of my encroaching on your privilege
of universal goodwill.  You need not.  There are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
few people whom I really love, and still fewer
of whom I think well.  The more I see of the
world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and
every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency
of all human characters, and of the little
dependence that can be placed on the appearance of
either merit or sense."  In a letter from Jane
Austen to Cassandra there would have been
nothing to surprise us in this passage, which is
actually taken from the remarks of Elizabeth
Bennet to her sister on the subject of Bingley's
long silence after the Netherfield ball.
</p>

<p>
If Jane Austen did not cry over misfortunes
which did not affect her, neither did she pretend
to ignore the affectations and weaknesses even of
her nearest relations.  Can it be supposed, for
instance, that she was in the least degree blinded
to the shortcomings of a beloved mother of whom
she could, on various occasions, write such news
as that she "continues hearty, her appetite and
nights are very good, but she sometimes complains
of an asthma, a dropsy, water in her chest,
and a liver disorder"?
</p>

<p>
A daughter and sister and friend whose attention
was so closely devoted, however
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
unobtrusively, to the study of character in a narrow circle,
would in most cases be "a little trying," but when
the observer was endowed with a keen sense of
the absurd, and an irony which, however weak in
caustic, was strong in veracity, it might be
supposed that she would be an <i>enfant terrible</i> of that
mature kind which in our own days is commoner
than the nursery variety.  In her case, the
supposition would be ill-founded.  She was at once
too well-bred, and too kind-hearted, to let her
special powers of wounding take exercise on
gentle hearts.  But falsehood of any sort was
abhorrent to her, and as a consequence she was
inclined, in communing with her sister, to show
herself a little intolerant even of those amiable
pretences of sorrow for common ailments and
small troubles which are so soothing to weak
humanity.  She rejected, for example, the idea
of commiserating with any one on account of a
cold or a headache, unless there were feverish
symptoms!
</p>

<p>
Of the "vacant chaff well-meant for grain" of
which Tennyson sings so sadly, Jane brought
little to market.  She would express to Cassandra
her sympathy with their acquaintances under great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
disasters and trivial misfortunes with the same
penful of ink.  What she wrote to her sister&mdash;of
her devotion for whom, from earliest childhood,
her mother said, "If Cassandra was going to have
her head cut off, Jane would insist on sharing her
fate"&mdash;is far more free than what she uttered in the
family circle.  Few have realized better the value
of the unspoken word, or given their relations
less opportunity to remind them of the evils of
indiscretion.
</p>

<p>
If she was unemotional and, in the ordinary
sense of the word, unsympathetic, she is not to
be blamed for this lack of the qualities with one
of which she so amply endowed Marianne and
with the other Elinor Dashwood.  We can no
more make ourselves emotional or sympathetic
than we can make ourselves fair or dark, or rather,
we can only alter our ways as we can alter our
complexions, by artifice.  The outward show of
sympathy which is not felt is one of the commonest
of hypocrisies, perhaps inevitable at times
from very charity.  Happily it is not a necessary
part of that ultimate barrier which, even in the
truest friendships and the deepest love, makes it
as impossible for one human being to see the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
whole of another's heart as it is impossible to see
more than a little of the "other side" of the
moon.  We cannot help being more or less
unfeeling, but we can subdue our selfishness in
action.  Almost everything that can be learned
about Jane Austen strengthens the conviction
that she was one of the least selfish of women.
</p>

<p>
In her last illness the fidelity of her spirit is
constantly shown, and her affection becomes more
unreserved in its utterance.  There is one letter
wherein, after speaking of Cassandra, she says,
in a phrase curiously suggestive of Thackeray:
"As to what I owe her, and the anxious affection
of all my beloved family on this occasion, I can
only cry over it, and pray God to bless them more
and more."
</p>

<p>
That she was by nature "meek and lowly," as
one of her American adorers declares, I cannot
believe, but if she preferred the spacious rooms
and well-spread board of her brother's mansion
to the common parlour and boiled mutton-and-turnips
of her father's rectory, she did not grizzle
over her state, nor did she allow her conscious
superiority of intelligence to claim distinction in
her home.  One of the few glimpses (apart from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
her own writings) that we have of her in her family
relations is when, in the closing year of her life,
her illness having begun to weaken her body, she
was obliged to lie down frequently during the
day.  There was only one sofa at Chawton
Cottage, and although Mrs. Austen, in spite of
the many ailments she had formerly complained
of, was a tolerably healthy old lady, the stricken
daughter made herself a couch by putting several
chairs together, and declared that she preferred
it to the sofa which her mother commonly
occupied.  Sofas, we must remember, were at
least as rare then as oak-panelled walls are now.
It was in those days that Cobbett regretted that
the sofa had ever been introduced into his
country, and he no doubt, according to his habit,
held the Prime Minister responsible for the aid
to effeminate indulgence of which his
contemporary Cowper sang.
</p>

<p>
Jane's discontent with the comparative poverty
of her surroundings was not translated into ill
temper.  There are many reasons for believing,
and few indeed for doubting, that she tried to do
her duty in that state of life to which she was
born, and from which she was not destined to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
emerge into the more varied pleasures and pains
of a larger world.  What if, among those whom
she trusted, she could not resist expressing the
lively thoughts suggested to her acute wit by
the acts or utterances of her friends.  She was
the pride of her family, and its sunshine, even
if her rays were more akin to the sun as we know
him on a fine spring day at home than as we seek
him on the Côte d'Azur.
</p>

<p>
She seems to have been more nearly understood
among the clergy and squires, and other
members of her family, than most humourists in
their immediate circles.  The common experience
of the genius in childhood and youth, if
biographers are to be credited, is for the delicate
shoots of his intelligence to be nipped by domestic
frosts; but if there had been any freezing in the
Austen family, it was more likely to be produced
by the chill of Jane's own satirical remarks than
by any harm that the convention and narrowness
of others could do to a mind so well defended as
hers.  There are few traces of any such wintry
weather having occurred at Steventon or Chawton.
Jane was certainly beloved, greatly and
deservedly, in her home.  She was, no doubt, a little
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
lonely, as genius, one may suppose, must always
be, and as those who are blest, or curst, with a
strong sense of the absurd must be whether they
be geniuses or not.  Her sister was her closest
friend, but Jane's published letters to Cassandra,
read in the light of the novels, suggest a reserve
in discussing her inmost thoughts with that
devoted spirit which seems hardly compatible with
the closest concordance of ideas, in spite of the
completest concordance of affection and a high
respect on Jane's part for Cassandra's sound sense
and critical judgment.  Very different is the tone
of the letters of that other pretty humourist,
Dorothy Osborne, to William Temple.  In
Dorothy's case there was a perfect confidence in
the entire sympathy and comprehension of the
recipient.  This factor apart, how much there is
in common between the two dear women.  The
one was dead more than eighty years before the
other was born, but in all the history of womanhood
is there any pair in which the smiling philosophy
that is the salt of the mind is more fairly
divided?  Jane Austen lives still in Elizabeth
Bennet and in Emma Woodhouse; Dorothy
Osborne only in her sweet self.  The one had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
no passion but her work&mdash;and it was a quiet,
unconsuming passion.  The other had no passion
but her love, and it was never able to overmaster
her intelligence.  "In earnest," she wrote, "I am
no more concerned whether people think me
handsome or ill-favoured, whether they think I have
wit or that I have none, than I am whether they
think my name Elizabeth or Dorothy."  It was
not quite true in her case, nor would it have been
in Jane's, but it contains no more exaggeration
than is allowed to any woman of sense, and it was
as true of the one as of the other.
</p>

<p>
Love has lately been defined by a ruthless
analyzer of feelings as "a specific emotion,
exclusive in selection, more or less permanent in
duration, and due to a mental fermentation in itself
caused by a law of attraction."  Jane Austen had
never read such an explanation of love as this, yet
her views on the most powerful of the mixings of
animal and spiritual instincts are usually more
placid than would please the fancies of maidens
who sleep with bits of wedding-cake beneath
their pillows.  That passionate love "is woman's
whole existence" is not exemplified by Jane's
favourite heroines.  Emma or Elizabeth did not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
so regard it, even if Anne Elliot did lose some of
her good looks and Catherine Morland her appetite
when their hopes of particular bridegrooms
seemed likely to be disappointed.  Elizabeth
would not have worried greatly over Darcy if he
had not come back for her, and Emma would
have been as happy at Hartfield without a husband
as she had always been, so long as Knightley
was friendly.
</p>

<p>
We cannot imagine that Jane Austen could ever
have written to any man, as Dorothy Osborne
wrote to Temple of a love which she could not
make her family understand: "For my life I
cannot beat into their heads a passion that must
be subject to no decay, an even perfect kindness
that must last perpetually, without the least
intermission.  They laugh to hear me say that one
unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of
my life, and that I should expect our kindness
should increase every day, if it were possible, but
never lessen."
</p>

<p>
The conjugal instinct was not strongly
developed in Jane; and, although she seems to have
been very fond of children, and especially of her
nephews and nieces, it may be assumed with some
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
confidence that the maternal instinct also found
little place in her nature.
</p>

<p>
Marianne Dashwood, emotional, fastidiously
truthful&mdash;she left to her elder sister "the whole
task of telling lies when politeness required
it"&mdash;romantically fond of scenery and poetry as any
of Mrs. Radcliffe's heroines, stands out among the
girls of Jane's imagining as the only one who
outwardly exhibits the conventional signs of
passionate affection for a lover, Catherine's and
Fanny's emotions being more suggestive of
maiden fancies, of "the flimsy furniture of a
country miss's brain," than of the yearnings of a
Juliet or a Roxane.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless the idea that the Austen people are
cold-blooded is warmly opposed in an appreciative
little essay published in America a few years
ago by Mr. W. L. Phelps.  "Let no one believe,"
he writes, "that Jane Austen's men and women
are deficient in passion because they behave with
decency: to those who have the power to see and
interpret, there is a depth of passion in her
characters that far surpasses the emotional power
displayed in many novels where the lovers seem to
forget the meaning of such words as honour,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
virtue, and fidelity."  It may be that, like Richard
Feverel on a certain occasion, the Henrys and
Edwards, the Emmas and Annes are "too British
to expose their emotions."  But Lucy Feverel,
one of the purest and truest women in fiction,
shows passion so that no special "power to see
and interpret" is requisite on the reader's part,
and the same note is true of many of the charming
heroines drawn by the masters of imagination.
</p>

<p>
At any rate Jane allowed her heroines as much
passion and sentiment as&mdash;so far as we can
discover&mdash;she experienced herself.  The one known
man who seems to have come near to being
regarded as her accepted lover was Thomas
Lefroy, who lived to be Chief Justice of Ireland.
</p>

<p>
"You scold me so much," she writes, in her
twenty-first year, to Cassandra, "in the nice long
letter which I have this moment received from
you, that I am almost afraid to tell you how
my Irish friend and I behaved.  Imagine to
yourself everything most profligate and
shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down
together.  I <i>can</i> expose myself, however, only <i>once
more</i>, because he leaves the country soon after
next Friday, on which day we <i>are</i> to have a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
dance at Ashe after all.  He is a very
gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man, I
assure you.  But as to our having ever met,
except at the three last balls, I cannot say
much; for he is so excessively laughed at about
me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of coming to
Steventon, and ran away when we called on
Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago."
</p>

<p>
No coquettish "reigning beauty" was ever more
easy as to the fate of her lovers, or less likely to
suffer at their hands, than this Hampshire maiden,
whose fine complexion, hazel eyes, and
well-proportioned figure attracted so much admiration, and
whose sweet voice and lively conversation completed
the conquest of those whom she cared to entertain.
</p>

<p>
"Tell Mary," she writes to her sister (also in
1796), "that I make over Mr. Heartley and all his
estate to her for her sole use and benefit in future,
and not only him, but all my other admirers into
the bargain wherever she can find them, even
the kiss which C. Powlett wanted to give me,
as I mean to confine myself in future to
Mr. Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't care six-pence."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
</p>

<p>
This agreeable Irishman, to whom, in later
years, we find references in the records of the
Edgeworth family, was speedily to pass out of
Jane's young life.  Very soon she has to write:
"At length the day is come on which I am to
flirt my last with Tom Lefroy, and when you
receive this it will be over.  My tears flow as I
write at the melancholy idea.  William Chute
called here yesterday.  I wonder what he means
by being so civil."
</p>

<p>
We need not picture her as stopping her writing
while she wiped the tears from her streaming eyes.
"We went by Bifrons," she says on another
occasion, "and I contemplated with a melancholy
pleasure the abode of him on whom I once fondly
doted."  She never did "dote" on any man, so
far as can be discovered or reasonably surmised,
to any greater extent than her favourite Emma
may be said to have "doted" on Frank Churchill.
Emma's feelings about the man who was secretly
engaged to Jane Fairfax at the time, are thus
analyzed by Jane Austen&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her
being in love.  Her ideas only varied as to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
how much.  At first she thought it was a good
deal; and afterwards but little.  She had great
pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of;
and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever in
seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often
thinking of him, and quite impatient for a letter,
that she might know how he was, how were his
spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance
of his coming to Randalls again this spring.  But,
on the other hand, she could not admit herself
to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to
be less disposed for employment than usual....
'I do not find myself making any use of the word
<i>sacrifice</i>,' said she.  'In not one of all my clever
replies, my delicate negatives, is there any
allusion to making a sacrifice.  I do suspect that he
is not really necessary to my happiness.  So much
the better.  I certainly will not persuade myself
to feel more than I do.  I am quite enough in
love.  I should be sorry to be more.'"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Save for Willoughby's burst of misplaced
enthusiasm over Marianne, Frank Churchill's
description of Jane Fairfax to Emma is the
warmest bit of love-painting in the Austen
comedy&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"She is a complete angel.  Look at her.  Is
not she an angel in every gesture?  Observe the
turn of her throat.  Observe her eyes, as she is
looking up at my father.  You will be glad to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)
that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's
jewels.  They are to be new set.  I am resolved
to have some in an ornament for the head.  Will
not it be beautiful in her dark hair?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Such raptures as these are rarely permitted
to the Austen lovers.  In their affairs of the heart,
as in the general conduct of their lives, plain
living and quiet thinking reflect the simple habits
of the people among whom Jane passed her own
smoothly-ordered life.
</p>

<p>
To the simplicity of that life we owe one of her
peculiar charms.  If she had been the famous,
sought-after literary woman who is the necessary
complement of a dinner-party in a house of
cultured luxury, and whose name is found in the
index of every volume of contemporary reminiscences,
she would not have been half so attractive
to the type of mind that most enjoys her novels.
Yet when all possible allowance has been made
for her lightness of expression her own predilections
were certainly for the conditions of "opulent
leisure" rather than of decent comfort, for the
amenities of Mansfield Park and Pemberley
rather than for those of Fullerton Rectory or the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
Dashwoods' cottage.  "People get so horridly
poor and economical in this part of the world,"
she wrote from Steventon to her sister at
Godmersham, "that I have no patience with them.
Kent is the only place for happiness; everybody
is rich there."
</p>

<p>
This was written early in her life.  In the year
before she died, writing to her niece Fanny, she
said: "Single women have a dreadful propensity
for being poor, which is one very strong argument
in favour of matrimony, but I need not dwell
on such arguments with <i>you</i>, pretty dear."
</p>

<p>
Contempt for poverty is expressed by several
characters in her work.  "Be honest and poor, by
all means"&mdash;says Mary Crawford to Edmund
Bertram&mdash;"but I shall not envy you; I do not
much think I shall even respect you.  I have a
much greater respect for those that are honest and rich."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps neither the real Jane nor the imaginary
Mary is to be taken quite literally, but that Jane
would have freely assented to a disbelief in the
wisdom of marrying on a small income, however
little she approved of Mary's "too positive
admiration for wealth," is certain from all that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
we know of her opinions on the essentials of
happiness.
</p>

<p>
Godmersham is in Kent, and it was in that
spacious, well-provided house of her brother
Edward, amid all the charms of parks and
beechwoods, of home comforts and "elegances" that
marked the life of the large landowner in those
days, that she usually found herself most
contented.  Then was the time when the squire was
not driven to find an income by letting his manor
to a company promoter to whom the difference
between an oak and an elm is scarcely known,
and whose chief object in hiring a mansion in
rural surroundings is to fill it with week-end
parties who play bridge indoors on summer afternoons
and leave the beauties of the gardens and
the park to the peacocks and the deer.
</p>

<p>
With such a modern plutocrat Jane would have
had little in common, but she would have had less
with the modern Socialist.  Landed property
stood for everything stable and dignified in her
days, and those critics of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>
who unkindly emphasized the fact that Elizabeth
Bennet only decided to marry Darcy after she
had seen the glories of Pemberley and its park
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
and gardens, while they implicitly libelled the
girl, were not so unfair to the general sentiment
of her period.  Sir Walter Scott, by the way, was
one of those who regarded Elizabeth Bennet's
change of feeling towards Darcy as the result of
her visit to the fine place in Derbyshire.  Surely
such a view connotes a failure to appreciate the
humour of the conversation on this point between
Jane Bennet and her sister.  The elder girl asks
the younger how long it is since she has felt any
affection for Darcy, and Elizabeth replies: "It
has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly
know when it began; but I believe I must date
it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at
Pemberley."  Even Jane Bennet, whose humour
sense was not strongly developed, asks her to give
a serious answer.
</p>

<p>
This much may be admitted, that the idea
of marrying the curate never presented itself to
any one of the maidens who brighten the novels
of Jane Austen with their charms of mind and
appearance.  Elinor Dashwood seems to have
regarded about £600 a year (with sure prospect
of increase) as the minimum on which married
life could hopefully be entered upon, and I fancy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
Jane would have agreed with her.  The majority
of novel-readers may still prefer the hero and
heroine whose love will triumph over all obstacles
of position, and opposition, of want of sympathy
on the part of others or of sense on their own,
and there have actually been readers who thought
Lydia Bennet more "interesting" than Elizabeth!
The prudence of the heroines may to
some small extent account for the failure of Jane
Austen's work to captivate the "great heart of the
public."  In any case her fame is far from
universal.  She has never been, and never will
be, popular in the sense in which the men and
women whose publishers cheerfully print first
editions of a hundred thousand copies are popular.
Her appeal, in her own lifetime, when her name
was unknown, was not to "the general," and it is
only much less restricted now because of the
enormous increase in the reading public.  Actually
it is immensely greater; relatively, its increase is
evidently small.  One cannot, as in the case of
some authors, describe her work as being enjoyed
only by the cultured class, and neglected, because
misapprehended, by the rest.  True culture is
always discriminating, even in the presence of its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
divinities.  Mr. Anthony Hope said not long ago,
referring to literary snobbishness: "There are
certain companies in which to suggest, even with
the utmost humility, that certain parts of Jane
Austen's novels are less entertaining than other
parts is thought considerably worse than
drawing invidious distinctions between various
passages of Holy Writ."
</p>

<p>
With those who regard Jane Austen's work as
equally excellent in every part, no patience is
possible.  The reader who finds it easy to get as
much enjoyment from <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> or
<i>Northanger Abbey</i> as from <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>
or <i>Mansfield Park</i> must be blessed with a
comfortable absence of discrimination.  Those who
see no degree of superiority in the presentation
of the characters of Elizabeth Bennet and Anne
Elliot as compared with Elinor Dashwood and
Catherine Morland might be expected to regard
Blanche Amory and Mrs. Jarley as the equals
respectively of Becky Sharp and Mrs. Gamp.
</p>

<p>
Such uncritical admiration as Mr. Anthony
Hope referred to is even more annoying than the
tone in which I have heard a distinguished writer
speak of Jane Austen as "that woman"&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
mildest of the contemptuous terms that Napoleon
applied to Madame de Staël.  The author who
spoke of Jane Austen so slightingly admitted her
power of presenting a "bloodless" and trivial
society in a life-like manner.  No such recognition
of power is allowed to her by an American
critic of to-day, who says of her work "it may be
called art, but it is a poor species of that old
art which depended for its effect upon false
similitudes."  It is hard to believe that the writer
of this astonishing opinion had read many pages
of the author he thus condemned to a place among
the third-rates.

<p>
"I believe there is no constraint to be put upon
real genius; nothing but inclination can set it to
work," was one of the many sensible, if unoriginal,
observations of the monarch in whose reign Jane
Austen was born and died.  But the inclination
itself is usually started by external suggestions,
and it is a mere truism that most books are
written because others have appeared before
them.  Macaulay declared that but for Fanny
Burney's example Jane Austen would never have
been a novelist.  Some of her early attempts at
a complete novel did indeed take the epistolary
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
form which was common in the preceding age,
and was the method of her admired Richardson,
who, I think, fired her ambition quite as much as
Miss Burney.  It would also seem that Mrs. Radcliffe's
wild romances had induced in Jane the
desire to do something that should please by the
absence of every quality that had made them
popular.
</p>

<p>
I doubt if there is any author of any period to
whom the most famous remark of Buffon could
be more justly applied than to Jane Austen.  "<i>Le
style est la femme même</i>" is a conviction which
becomes more and more firm as one reads her
novels and her letters, and reflects over their
relationship.  Her simple life and her limited
opportunities, her genius being granted, are a sufficient
explanation of her work.  Part of that life, and
a part more important, in proportion to the rest,
than it would have been in the case of one who
had lived less remote from the world of thought
and action, was the reading of favourite books.
<i>Clarissa</i>, <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i> and <i>Pamela</i>
influenced her strongly, but she avoided more than
she took from them in the formation of her style.
Miss Burney she now and then laughs at a little,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
as when, after John Thorpe has said to Catherine
(who confesses she has never read <i>Camilla</i>):
"You had no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest
nonsense you can imagine; there is nothing in
the world in it but an old man's playing at
see-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul, there is
not," Jane Austen adds that "the justness" of
this critique "was unfortunately lost on poor
Catherine."  But where she loved she laughed.
She appreciated her sister-novelist's work very
highly, and she writes of a young woman whom
she met at a neighbour's house: "There are two
traits in her character which are pleasing&mdash;namely,
she admires Camilla, and drinks no cream in her
tea."
</p>

<p>
Scott's poetry, of course, Jane read and
enjoyed.  Three of his most popular novels&mdash;<i>Waverley</i>,
<i>Guy Mannering</i>, and <i>The Antiquary</i>&mdash;appeared
during her lifetime, and their authorship,
like that of her own works, was not avowed
until after her death.  How wide-open was the
"secret" of their origin from the very first, years
before Scott's acknowledgment, we may see in
one of Jane's letters of 1814, where she says:
"Walter Scott has no business to write novels;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
especially good ones.  It is not fair.  He has
fame and profit enough as a poet, and should
not be taking the bread out of the mouths of
other people.  I do not like him, and do not mean
to like <i>Waverley</i> if I can help it, but I fear I
must."  She herself declared, half jestingly, that
she wrote for fame and not for profit.  Neither,
in any but shallow measure, was granted to her
whilst she lived.  She did not, like Robert Burns,
"pant after distinction," nor was she of the
"pushing" type.  The offering-up of self-respect in
the cause of self-interest was the least possible of
sacrifices with her.
</p>

<p>
The machine-made horrors of Ann Radcliffe&mdash;"<i>la
reine des épouvantements</i>" as she has been
aptly called, in spite of her retiring disposition&mdash;were
as familiar to Jane as were those, far less
<i>pouvantable</i>, of Ainsworth to the girls of a later
generation.  The Radcliffe novels were published
between Jane's fourteenth and twenty-third years,
when she was most open to romantic influences,
but however much she may have shuddered over
them in her teens, she laughed at them in her
twenties, and it is certainly to the desire to satirize
the melodramatic sensations of the school of fiction
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
which they represent that we chiefly owe <i>Northanger
Abbey</i>, a pleasant mixture of a serious love-story
and a burlesque, a motto for which might
have been found in a sonnet of Shakespeare:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br />
  Coral is far more red than her lips' red:<br />
<span style="letter-spacing: 4em">*****</span><br />
  I grant I never saw a goddess go,&mdash;<br />
  My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It is in this novel that, leaving her characters for a
page or two to take care of themselves, the author
thus refers to the sorrows of the novel-making
craft, and expresses her high appreciation of the
work of Miss Burney and of Miss Edgeworth&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Let us not desert one another&mdash;we are an
injured body.  Although our productions have
afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure
than those of any other literary corporation in the
world, no species of composition has been so much
decried.  From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our
foes are almost as many as our readers; and while
the abilities of the nine-hundredth abridger of
the history of England, or of the man who collects
and publishes in a volume some dozen lines
of Milton, Pope, and Prior, with a paper from the
<i>Spectator</i>, and a chapter from Sterne, are
eulogized by a thousand pens,&mdash;there seems almost a
general wish of decrying the capacity and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and of slighting
the performances which have only genius, wit, and
taste to recommend them.  'I am no novel-reader.&mdash;I
seldom look into novels.&mdash;Do not imagine that
'<i>I</i> often read novels.&mdash;It is really very well for
a novel.'  Such is the common cant.  'And what
are you reading, Miss&mdash;&mdash;?'  'Oh! it is only a
novel!' replies the young lady; while she lays
down her book with affected indifference, or
momentary shame.  'It is only <i>Cecilia</i>, or <i>Camilla</i>,
or <i>Belinda</i>;' or, in short, only some work in which
the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in
which the most thorough knowledge of human
nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the
liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed
to the world in the best-chosen language.  Now,
had the same young lady been engaged with a
volume of the <i>Spectator</i>, instead of such a work,
how proudly would she have produced the book,
and told its name! though the chances must be
against her being occupied by any part of that
voluminous publication of which either the matter
or manner would not disgust a young person of
taste; the substance of its papers so often
consisting in the statement of improbable circumstances,
unnatural characters, and topics of conversation,
which no longer concern any one living; and their
language, too, frequently so coarse as to give no
very favourable idea of the age that could endure
it."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
</p>

<p>
This is a hard saying for those who count "Sir
Roger de Coverley," "Mr. Bickerstaff," and many
"Clarindas" and "Sophronias" among their
friends.  The age of the Regency may or may
not have been as lax in its morality as some of its
detractors have declared, but that it was one in
which ladies could reasonably have been expected
to blush over the pages of the <i>Spectator</i> is not
easily to be believed.
</p>

<p>
The girls in the manor-houses and parsonages
of those days formed their literary tastes on native
productions without going abroad for their novels.
They did not read French fiction as their
grandmothers and great-grandmothers had done, or as
their cousins in town still did in spite of such
warnings as that of a contemporary critic who
held it scarcely possible to read French "without
contracting some pollution, so extensively and
radically is its whole literature depraved."  Times
had changed since Dorothy Osborne discussed
the voluminous romances of Calprenède and
Mademoiselle de Scudéri with William Temple.
</p>

<p>
Another important branch of Jane's private and
voluntary curriculum was her reading not only in
the "coarse" journalism of Steele and Addison
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
and their colleagues, but in the various successors
of the <i>Spectator</i> and the <i>Tatler</i> which had their
little days and died, particularly during the reign
of George II.  Not only in the <i>Rambler</i> and the
<i>Idler</i> of the great man whom she so highly
respected, but in the <i>World</i>, the <i>Mirror</i>, the
<i>Lounger</i>, the <i>Connoisseur</i>, and other less
remembered publications of their class, you may come
upon characters and reflections and incidents
which may have afforded fruitful suggestions to
one who, after the manner of genius, could turn
even the dulness of others into sparkling delight
of her own.
</p>

<p>
Her favourite poet was Crabbe.  She never met
him, but she was so charmed by his work that, as
her nephew has recorded, she used jokingly to
say, "If she ever married at all, she could fancy
being Mrs. Crabbe."  Her appreciation of such
poems as <i>The Village</i> and <i>The Parish Register</i>
is suggestive.  She herself made no attempt to
illustrate the "simple annals of the poor."  Born
in a family which was itself a part of the landed
gentry, in those days in its pride, she was obviously
conscious of a lofty barrier between her own class
and the peasantry.  George Crabbe, on the other
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
hand, the son of lowly folk, was born and nurtured
in poverty, and he never forgot that he had sprung
from the sand-dunes of the East Coast.  His
pictures of the poor, their sorrows and joys, fill the
most delightful of his verses; his ease in their
society, his understanding of their minds and
characters mark him off as clearly from Jane
Austen as&mdash;to take a very modern instance&mdash;the
admirable and sympathetic pictures of farm-life in
la Vendée offered in <i>La Terre qui meurt</i> distinguish
M. René Bazin from M. Marcel Batilliat,
who has dealt so feelingly with the decadence of
the château in <i>La Vendée aux Genêts</i>.  Jane
found in Crabbe something that she missed in
herself, a ready appreciation of all classes.
</p>

<p>
She loved Cowper too, both in his poems and
his prose.  There was much in <i>The Task</i> that
could not but please her, though the humour must
have struck her as being exceedingly mild, and
the descriptions over-laboured.  Cowper, though
kindly to the rural poor, and often referring to
their occupations, smiles derisively at those who
pretend to envy the labourer's lot and to regard
his cottage, if properly "rose-bordered," as
preferable to any other kind of residence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "So farewell envy of the <i>peasant's nest</i>!<br />
  If Solitude make scant the means of life,<br />
  Society for me! thou seeming sweet,<br />
  Be still a pleasing object in my view;<br />
  My visit still, but never mine abode."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jane was wholly in accord with the sentiment of
these lines.  In some verses&mdash;composed in 1807
for a family competition in producing rhymes
with "rose"&mdash;which, but for the rhyming, are a
burlesque of Cowper's style, we find a picture of a
cottager, wherein, if the "poetry" be naturally of
small account, are lines that would mark it, without
the direct evidence of the name, as hers, and not
Cassandra's or Mrs. Austen's.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Happy the lab'rer in his Sunday clothes!<br />
  In light-drab coat, smart waistcoat, well darn'd hose,<br />
  And hat upon his head, to church he goes;<br />
  As oft, with conscious pride, he downward throws<br />
  A glance upon the ample cabbage-rose,<br />
  Which, stuck in button-hole, regales his nose,<br />
  He envies not the gayest London beaux.<br />
  In church he takes his seat among the rows,<br />
  Pays to the place the reverence he owes,<br />
  Likes best the prayers whose meaning least he knows,<br />
  Lists to the sermon in a softening doze,<br />
  And rouses joyous at the welcome close."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There is a letter of January 1758 from Johnson
to Bennet Langton which, as Boswell remarks,
shows its writer "in as easy and pleasant a state of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
existence, as constitutional unhappiness ever
permitted him to enjoy."  I cannot help quoting it
here as evidence of an affinity of Johnson, in his
happiest hours, with his constitutionally cheerful
admirer, Jane Austen&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"The two Wartons just looked into the town,
and were taken to see <i>Cleone</i>, where, David says,
they were starved for want of company to keep
them warm.  David and Doddy have had a new
quarrel, and, I think, cannot conveniently quarrel
any more.  <i>Cleone</i> was well acted by all the
characters, but Bellamy left nothing to be desired.
I went the first night, and supported it as well as
I might; for Doddy, you know, is my patron, and
I would not desert him.  The play was very well
received.  Doddy, after the danger was over,
went every night to the stage-side, and cried at
the distress of poor Cleone.  I have left off
housekeeping, and therefore made presents of
the game which you were pleased to send me.
The pheasant I gave to Mr. Richardson, the
bustard to Dr. Lawrence, and the pot I placed
with Miss Williams, to be eaten by myself....
Mr. Reynolds has within these few days raised
his price to twenty guineas a head, and Miss is
much employed in miniatures.  I know not
anybody else whose prosperity has increased since
you left them."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
</p>

<p>
If the date and the reference to the writer's
relations with the dramatist had been suppressed
the letter might have been given as one of Jane's
own without arousing suspicion in any but a
confirmed "Boswellian."  "David" is Garrick, of
course, while "Doddy" is Dodsley, author of
the play, and the fortunate recipient of the
Langton pheasant is the author of <i>Clarissa</i>, another of
Jane's favourites more than thirty years after,
when she had had time to be born and grow up.
</p>

<p>
Richardson, Fanny Burney, Ann Radcliffe, Maria
Edgeworth (after 1800), Scott (as poet), Johnson,
Crabbe, and Cowper, then, afforded the more
solid literary nourishment of Jane Austen.  She
had studied the essayists of Queen Anne's time
and their emulators, and was not unfamiliar with
Fielding, and she did not neglect the ordinary
books that came from the circulating libraries of
the day.  "Mrs. Martin," she writes of a bookseller
in her neighbourhood who had started such
a library, "as an inducement to subscribe tells me
that her collection is not to consist only of novels,
but of every kind of literature, etc.  She might
have spared this pretension to <i>our</i> family, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
are great novel-readers, and not ashamed of being
so; but it was necessary, I suppose, to the
self-consequence of half her subscribers."  Unhappily,
this "high-class" venture was a total
failure.
</p>

<p>
The novels supplied by "Mrs. Martin" and
others, forerunners of those which now go forth
from the Strand and Oxford Street, are frequently
referred to in Jane's letters, and some
of them, if we are so disposed, we can read at
the British Museum.  There was, for example,
Sarah Burney's <i>Clarentine</i>, which Jane and her
mother read for the third time (in 1807), and
"are surprised to find how foolish it is ... full
of unnatural conduct and forced difficulties";
there was <i>Self-Control</i>, a book "without anything
of nature or probability," but which Jane
feared might be "too clever," and that she might
find her own work forestalled by it; there was
the <i>Alphonsine</i> of Madame de Genlis, which
"did not do.  We were disgusted in twenty
pages, as, independent of a bad translation, it has
indelicacies which disgrace a pen hitherto so
pure"; and there was <i>Margiarna</i>, which the
Austens were reading in the winter of 1809, at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
Southampton, and "like very well indeed.  We
are just going to set off for Northumberland to
be shut up in Widdrington Tower, where there
must be two or three sets of victims already
immured under a very fine villain."
</p>

<p>
About the same time Cassandra tells of some
romance which the Godmersham circle has been
devouring, and Jane replies&mdash;"To set up against
your new novel, of which nobody ever heard
before, and perhaps never may again, we have
got <i>Ida of Athens</i>, by Miss Owenson, which
must be very clever, because it was written, as the
authoress says, in three months.  We have only
read the preface yet, but her Irish girl does not
make me expect much.  If the warmth of her
language could affect the body it might be worth
reading in this weather."
</p>

<p>
We shall not find much criticism of books either
in the novels or the letters.  There is a passage
in one of "Aunt Jane's" letters to her niece
Anna, written in 1814, in which her point of view
on one important question of style is clearly
expressed.  Anna, probably inspired by her aunt's
example&mdash;for the authorship of <i>Sense and
Sensibility</i> and <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> had leaked out
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
in the family in spite of all precaution&mdash;had
written a novel herself, and had sent the MS. to
Jane for kindly consideration and advice.  The
result was not wholly encouraging&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Your Aunt C. (Cassandra) does not like desultory
novels, and is rather afraid yours will be too
much so, that there will be too frequently a change
from one set of people to another, and that
circumstances will be introduced of apparent
consequence which will lead to nothing.  It will not
be so great an objection to me if it does.  I allow
much more latitude than she does, and think
nature and spirit cover many sins of a wandering
story, and people in general do not care so much
about it for your comfort....  I have scratched
out the introduction between Lord Portman and
his brother and Mr. Griffin.  A country surgeon
(don't tell Mr. C. Lyford) would not be introduced
to men of their rank, and when Mr. P. is first
brought in, he would not be introduced as the
Honourable.  That distinction is never mentioned
at such times, at least I believe not."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Of a later novel of Anna's, which Jane "read to
your Aunt Cassandra in our own room at night,
while we undressed," she tells the girl that
"Devereux Forester's being ruined by his vanity
is extremely good, but I wish you would not let
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
him plunge into a 'vortex of dissipation.'  I do
not object to the thing, but I cannot bear the
expression; it is such thorough novel slang, and
so old that I dare say Adam met with it in the first
novel he opened...."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Austen had said, and Jane agreed with her,
that Anna had allowed a married couple in the
novel to be too long in returning a visit from
the Vicar's wife, and Jane had ventured to
expunge, as "too familiar and inelegant," the
"Bless my heart" in which Sir Thomas, one of
the characters, indulged.  Jane's own Emma
might say "Good God!" when she pleased, but
Anna's Sir Thomas might not even bless his
heart!
</p>

<p>
A last criticism on Anna's book is worth quoting
for its direct bearing on the critic's own method.
"You describe a sweet place, but your descriptions
are often more minute than will be liked.  You
give too many particulars of right hand and
left."
</p>

<p>
Jane's estimate of her own manner of work is
modest enough.  "The little bit (two inches wide)
of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush as
produces little effect after much labour," she says.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
With this phrase of her own as a text she has been
called a "miniaturist," but if authors and artists
are to be compared, there is quite as much of the
selection and the richness of a Gainsborough in
her work as of the minuteness of a Metzu or a
Meissonier.
</p>

<p>
In her reply to the amazing proposal of the
librarian at Carlton House that she should compose
an historical romance founded on the records
of the Saxe-Coburg family, she writes, not without
a touch of her gentle satire&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"I am fully sensible that (such a romance)
might be much more to the purpose of profit or
popularity than such pictures of domestic life in
country villages as I deal in.  But I could no
more write a romance than an epic poem.  I could
not sit seriously down to write a serious romance
under any other motive than to save my life; and
if it were indispensable for me to keep it up and
never relax into laughing at myself or at any other
people, I am sure I should be hung before I had
finished the first chapter.  No, I must keep to my
own style and go on in my own way; and though I
may never succeed again in that, I am convinced
that I should totally fail in any other."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Her limitations of subject are clear to her own
mind.  Even of the "domestic life in villages"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
she would only deal with the side where the daily
bread was provided out of income, not out of
retail profits or weekly wages.  It is a suggestive
fact, to which I have already alluded, that she
never even tried to draw a peasant's family.  Her
heroines may, on the rarest occasions, call at a
cottage to inquire after a sick child or leave a
charitable gift, but of the conditions under which
the labouring classes lived, during the hard times
of the French wars, we learn nothing at all from
her writings.  The nearest approaches to such
subjects are the account of the Prices' home at
Portsmouth (a sordid interior which has been held,
I think not unjustly, to be as vivid in its
suggestion of impecuniosity and discomfort as anything
written by Zola), and the similar, but far less
effective, picture of the Watsons' family life.
</p>

<p>
Her literary style seems to be spontaneous, and
so, in comparison with that of "stylists," it
certainly is.  She had stored her mind with good
literature while still in her teens, and no doubt
most of her limpid sentences flowed freely from
her pen.  But the consistent absence of superfluous
epithets and other redundancies is evidence
that she had consciously formed an ideal of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
composition, and that she thought out the means of
producing her effects is clear from several
passages in her letters.  To her niece who addressed
her as "Dear Miss Darcy," and wanted her to
answer in that character, Jane replied&mdash;"Even
had I more time I should not feel at all sure
of the sort of letter that Miss D. would write."  She
had studied her art till she could analyze
its qualities, as we may see from a letter written
from Chawton in 1813.  Mrs. Austen had been
reading <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> aloud to Jane and
Martha Lloyd (who lived with the Austens), and
Jane tells Cassandra that&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Though she perfectly understands the characters
herself, she cannot speak as they ought.
Upon the whole, however, I am quite vain enough,
and well satisfied enough.  The work is rather too
light and bright and sparkling, it wants shade&mdash;to
be stretched out here and there ... an essay
on writing, a critique on Walter Scott, or the
history of Buonaparte, or something that would
form a contrast, and bring the reader with
increased delight to the playfulness and
epigrammatism of the general style."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Happily she did not provide the conventional
"shade," which would have been on a par with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
the "brown tree" that, according to Sir George
Beaumont, was an indispensable feature of every
properly composed landscape painting.  Shade,
however, did appear in several chapters of
<i>Persuasion</i>, which, for a certain suggestion of
melancholy, stands apart from the other novels, though
not as markedly as <i>Northanger Abbey</i> stands
apart for its exuberant frivolity.
</p>

<p>
Macaulay declared of Fanny Burney's later
style that it was "the worst that has ever been
known among men."  Jane Austen's style, in its
happy hours, is so admirably adapted to its
purpose that, while we may not call it "the best," a
term which advertisement has rendered meaningless
as a standard of excellence, it has never been
surpassed as a means to a desired end.  It seems
trite to say that the first point to consider in any
question of style is the intended result, but it is a
point so frequently overlooked that much criticism
about art and letters, as about politics or agriculture,
is vitiated by the hopeless effort to set up an
abstract ideal applicable to all cases, like a
universal watch-key.
</p>

<p>
The result for which Jane Austen worked can
scarcely be put in question.  She was impelled to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
make her little world live in fiction, not precisely
as she saw it and heard it, but as she could most
attractively present it to minds possessing the
indispensable modicum of humour, without which
the charm is lost at least as nearly as the charm of
a Turner sunset by a person whose optic nerve is
irresponsive to the red rays.  Apart from her
prevailing humour, the modesty of her style is a
continual beauty.  There is none of that florid
eloquence which depends more on sound than
sense for its effect, nor of that forcing of strange
phrases which in these days so often passes for
literary excellence.  There is no preciosity about
her books; the narrative is easy, the incidents are
probable; the dialogue, with few exceptions, is
natural, the bright people being differentiated
from the dull by their talk, and not, as in most
novels, by the author's assurances.  If Mr. Meredith
was right when he declared that "it is unwholesome
for men and women to see themselves
as they are, if they are no better than they should
be," there must be many "unwholesome" pages
in Jane Austen's work for the tolerably large class
to which he referred.  Neither in real life nor in
the life of her books did she "suffer fools gladly,"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
and so far as the men of her creation are concerned
she is on the whole more successful in representing
the foolish than the wise.  Her chief failure is
in the realization of such a young man as one of
her heroines would have been likely to admire.
Most of the younger men are sketchily drawn, and
we who are men would fain believe that she did not
understand the nature of a man's heart, seeing that
she never found one worth accepting.  Knightley
and Bertram seem to have been favourites of hers,
but they are not lively people, nor sufficiently
wanting in priggishness.  The liveliest of them all
is Henry Tilney, whatever his qualities of mind.
The Jane Austen touch is charmingly varied, and
it is felt in some of its happy strokes in the talk
between this mercurial young rector and the girl
whose early-budding affections he so speedily
returns.

Mr. Collins is one of the most finished of Jane's
studies of men.  He comes near to the impossible
at times, but she makes him a living creature.
The speech in which he offers his hand and
advantages to his cousin Elizabeth has often been
quoted, and its charms can never fade.  Only a

"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think
it a right thing for every clergyman in easy
circumstances (like myself) to set the example of
matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am
convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness;
and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to have
mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice
and recommendation of the very noble lady whom
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
I have the honour of calling patroness.  Twice has
she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
too!) on this subject; and it was but the very
Saturday night before I left Hunsford&mdash;between
our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool&mdash;that she
said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry.  A clergyman
like you must marry.  Choose properly, choose a
gentlewoman for my sake, and for your own; let
her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought
up high, but able to make a small income go a
good way.  This is my advice.  Find such a
woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford,
and I will visit her.'  Allow me, by the way, to
observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the
notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh
as among the least of the advantages in my power
to offer.  You will find her manners beyond
anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity,
I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when
tempered with the silence and respect which her
rank will inevitably excite."

<p>
There is nothing "commonplace" about this.
What matter that the characters are only middle-class
and "respectable," if they can afford
material for such excellent wit?
</p>

<p>
In one respect, judged by the present standard
in fiction, Jane Austen's work assuredly is
"commonplace."  No novelist was ever less troubled
in the search for names.  She merely took those
of people she had heard of or met, preferring the
common to the unusual.  Bennet, Dashwood,
Elliot, Price, Woodhouse&mdash;names that the modern
"popular" novelist would reject at sight, served
her turn, a Darcy or a Tilney being her highest
flights in nomenclature.  As for the Christian
names, they are of the most ordinary and are used
over and over again.  In <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>,
for example, three of the prominent characters
are named John&mdash;John Dashwood, John Middleton,
and John Willoughby.  There are two
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
Catherines in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.  Elizabeths,
Fannys, Annes, Marys, Henrys, Edwards,
Roberts, "fill the bills," and such a name as
Frank Churchill seems recondite.  It is much the
same in the letters, the truth being that the
Gwladyses, and Evadnes, and Marmadukes of
those days were very rare, and almost unknown
in rural society.  The burden which her sister
Cassandra bore must have strengthened Jane's
determination that her heroes and heroines should
not have unusual names, and so we have our
Elinors and Elizabeths, and Fannys, with their
Edwards and Edmunds, and Henrys.  The
Darcys are almost the only exceptions that try
the rule; "Fitzwilliam" and "Georgiana" are more
in the style of the ordinary novel of "high life."
</p>

<p>
So much for names.  How are the men and
women who bear them "introduced" to us?
When a Colonel Newcome, or an Alfred Jingle,
or a Sylvain Pons comes upon the scene, we hear
a good deal about his personal appearance, his
manner of dress, his bearing, and those who
introduce him have a huge circle of men and women
to bring before us with similar formalities.
Jane Austen, like a casual hostess at a modern
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
dance, leaves us, as often as not, to make acquaintance
in any way we can.  Scott, with his wealth
of character-studies among high and middle and
low, his kings and cavaliers and covenanters and
crofters, was the most generous giver of types
among Jane Austen's contemporaries; Maria
Edgeworth in depicting the gentry and peasantry
of Ireland, and John Galt the small shop-keepers
and their customers in the Scottish country-towns,
managed to present us to a large circle of new
acquaintances, of various classes and occupations.
Jane had no use for characters, or centres of social
life, that required to be specially described for a
particular purpose.  Only in one of her novels
(<i>Sense and Sensibility</i>) is the busy life of London
made the subject of any but the most casual
description, and even then it is but the transference
of the country people to town, and of the
two or three towns-people back to their London
houses from their country visits that is effected.
(The general life of the metropolis, its theatres,
parks, and bustle are left, to all intent, unnoticed.
Yet, as we know from many passages in her
letters, Jane during her visits was a keen spectator
of the pageantry of life in a city which, she
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
jestingly declared, played havoc with her character.
"Here I am once more in this scene of dissipation
and vice," she writes from Cork Street in
August 1796, "and I begin already to find my
morals corrupted."  And in the next month she
sends this little message to Mr. Austen: "My
father will be so good as to fetch home his
prodigal daughter from town, I hope, unless
he wishes me to walk the hospitals, enter at
the Temple, or mount guard at St. James'."  She
was not "prodigal"&mdash;save in gloves and
ribbons&mdash;but she enjoyed the delights of the
country-cousin in town.  She went very often to
the play, so often at times as to be weary
of it.  <i>The Hypocrite</i> (Bickerstaff's "alteration"
of Cibber's "adaptation" of <i>Tartuffe</i>) "well
entertained" her, Dowton and Mathews being the
chief actors; and she saw Liston, Miss Stephens,
Miss O'Neill, and Kean at the outset of his fame.
"The Clandestine Marriage" was a favourite
piece, and on one occasion she notes that her
nieces, whom she sometimes took to the theatre,
"revelled last night in Don Juan, whom we left
in hell at half-past eleven."  Such joys,
however, did not move her mind enough to seduce
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
her from the country as a source of inspiration
for her work.
</p>

<p>
"<i>All</i> lives lived out of London are mistakes
more or less grievous&mdash;but mistakes," said Sydney
Smith, adapting, consciously or not, the saying
of Mascarille to the <i>Précieuses</i>: "Pour moi, Je
tiens que hors de Paris, il n'y a point de salut
pour les honnetes gens."  The life of Jane
Austen, whose humour the author of the <i>Plymley
Letters</i>, the father and uncle of a hundred
diverting anecdotes, so greatly enjoyed, may serve to
show the weakness of such unreserved generalization.
Her subjects were found in the restful
backwaters of life, not in the crowded centres
where mankind is more and more bewildered by
the failure of wisdom to keep pace with the
advance of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
It is one of Jane's qualities as a writer that
she shows little hospitality to the stock phrases
of ordinary people.  Lord Chesterfield told his
son: "If, instead of saying that tastes are
different, and that every man has his own peculiar
one, you should let off a proverb, and say, that
'What is one man's meat is another man's poison.'
... everybody would be persuaded that you had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
never kept company with anybody above footmen
and housemaids."  Proverbial philosophy finds
little encouragement from Jane, who places it in
the mouths of her least agreeable characters, and
one may believe, after reading her books and her
letters, that she agrees with her own Marianne
Dashwood, who, when Sir John Middleton has
dared to suggest that she will be "setting her
cap" at Willoughby, warmly replies: "That is
an expression, Sir John, which I particularly
dislike.  I abhor every commonplace phrase by
which wit is intended; and 'setting one's cap' at
a man, or 'making a conquest,' are the most
odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and
illiberal; and if their construction could ever be
deemed clever, time has long ago destroyed all
its ingenuity."  The offending Sir John "did not
much understand this reproof," but he "laughed
as heartily as if he did."  Elizabeth Bennet's use
of the saying, "Keep your breath to cool your
porridge," gives us a worse shock than it can have
given to Darcy, so unexpected is it from the mouth
of a Jane Austen heroine.  When one of
Cassandra's letters had diverted Jane "beyond
moderation," and she added: "I could die of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
laughter at it," she felt the banality of the phrase
as keenly as Marianne would have done, and
saved herself with "as they used to say at school."
</p>

<p>
Whatever the words and phrases she employed,
it can never be held that she "spoke well"
according to the test proposed by Catherine Morland
when she said to Henry Tilney, "I cannot speak
well enough to be unintelligible," a remark which
Mr. Tilney hailed with delight as "an excellent
satire on modern language."  Its origin may be
found in that first volume of <i>The Mirror</i> which
Catherine's mother brought down-stairs for her
edification, where we are told that "many great
personages contrive to be unintelligible in order
to be respected."
</p>

<p>
A peculiarity of Jane Austen's vocabulary and
manner is her fondness for negatives in "un,"
such words as "unabsurd," "unpretty,"
"unrepulsable," "unfastidious," "untoward," and
"unexceptionable"&mdash;a pet fancy of hers, which
occurs, I am told, at least eight times in <i>Emma</i>
alone&mdash;being as common in her novels as
"halidome" and "minion" in the older romances of
Wardour Street.  Some day, perhaps, a lost novel
of hers, written during the apparently idle years
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
of her residence at Bath, will be identified by the
prevalence of "uns" in its text.
</p>

<p>
In clarity of meaning her style is usually of
the purest, and there is reason to think that her
few obscurities are as often due to carelessness as
to defective art.  Not that she was exempt from
all the weaknesses that she discovers for our
amusement in the generality of her sex.  Henry
Tilney's appreciation of women as letter-writers
can hardly have been imagined without at least a
moment's reflection by the author over her own
achievements&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"'I have sometimes thought,' says Catherine,
doubtfully, 'whether ladies <i>do</i> write so much
better letters than gentlemen.  That is, I should
not think the superiority was always on our side.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'As far as I have had opportunity of judging,'
replies Tilney, 'it appears to me that the
usual style of letter-writing among women is
faultless, except in three particulars.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'And what are they?'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'A general deficiency of subject, a total
inattention to stops, and a very frequent ignorance
of grammar.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'Upon my word, I need not have been afraid
of disclaiming the compliment!  You do not
think too highly of us in that way.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'I should no more lay it down as a general
rule that women write better letters than men,
than that they sing better duets, or draw better
landscapes.  In every power, of which taste is
the foundation, excellence is pretty fairly divided
between the sexes.'"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Deficiency of subject has not been charged
against Jane's published letters, but they have
often been charged with deficiency of serious
interest.  Her works certainly do exhibit an
occasional looseness of grammar, mostly due to
bad punctuation.  The faulty construction of
Lucy's letters (<i>Sense and Sensibility</i>) is noted by
the author, but while Jane would not have been
likely to regard "Sincerely wish you happy in
your choice" as a proper way of beginning a
sentence, her own delinquencies with respect to
commas are sometimes no less grave than those
of Mrs. Robert Ferrars.  She would have felt no
serious sympathy with Cyrano's declaration
concerning his literary compositions&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "... Mon sang se coagule<br />
  En pensant qu'on y peut changer une virgule."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Her blood was too cool to be frozen by the
printer's fancies in punctuation.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
</p>

<p>
In an old number of the <i>Cambridge Observer</i>
the curious student may find some suggested
emendations of Jane Austen's text by
Mr. A. W. Verrall, many of them being concerned
with what are probably printers' errors.  Those
which deal with punctuation need not reflect on
the printer as prime offender.  The author was
a woman.  Mr. Verrall's ingenious suggestion
that when Jane Austen is made to say that
William Price's "direct holidays" might justly
be given to his friends at Mansfield Park
(his own family seeing him frequently at Portsmouth,
where his ship was lying), she really wrote
"derelict holidays," has little to commend it,
"direct" so evidently, I think, being used to
differentiate his actual leave from his ordinary
leisure hours when on service.  But there are two
emendations, typical of many which might be
suggested (Mr. Verrall has probably noted them
for the edition which he ought to undertake in
time for the centenary), which are entirely acceptable.
Fanny Price is made to say to Mr. Rushworth,
on the occasion when Maria Bertram and
Crawford gave that unfortunate person the slip in
his own garden, "They desired me to stay; my
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
cousin Maria charged me to say that you would
find them at that knoll, or thereabouts."  Mr. Verrall
justly observes that no one had desired Fanny
to stay, and she would be the last girl to utter
"an irrelevant falsehood."  He holds that "she
really did on this occasion, for kindness' sake, say
something 'not quite true,'" and it was: "They
desired me to say&mdash;my cousin Maria charged me
to say, that you would find them at that knoll,
or thereabouts."
</p>

<p>
Again, when in describing the discussion over
Mrs. Weston's proposed dance, Jane Austen is
made to say (in <i>Emma</i>), "The want of proper
families in the place, and the conviction that none
beyond the place and its immediate environs could
be attempted to attend, were mentioned," the
author's words were, in Mr. Verrall's opinion,
"tempted to attend."  Like Shakespeare's, the
MSS. of Jane Austen's masterpieces are to seek,
so that what she wrote we cannot prove.  The
probability that in these two cases, as in others,
the author omitted to notice in proof the errors
of the printer is more likely, on the whole, than
that her pen had slipped badly, and that her
"copy" had never been carefully read over.  She
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
cared little for such slips, however, as we know
from a letter written after <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>
was published, wherein she says: "There are a
few typical errors, and a 'said he' or 'said she'
would sometimes make the dialogue more
immediately clear, but 'I do not write for such dull
elves,' as have not a great deal of ingenuity
themselves."  "Typical," of course, is here used in
its obsolete sense of "typographical."
</p>

<p>
The negative bond of union referred to above
between Jane Austen and the only English writer
whom some of her eminent admirers have allowed
to take precedence of her&mdash;that the MSS. of both
have disappeared&mdash;suggests the passing reflection
that in these days when Shakespeare is not allowed
to hold the title to his plays without challenge,
when Anne and Emily Brontë are accused of
being (so far as the public is concerned) mere
pseudonyms of their sister Charlotte, when George
Henry Lewes has been given the credit for George
Eliot's novels, and the speeches of eminent statesmen
are said to be written by their wives, it is
rather surprising that no one in search of a striking
subject for a magazine article has attacked the
claims of Jane Austen to a place among English
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
authors.  There is no evidence in the memoirs
of her time that any distinguished person ever
found himself in her company, her name did not
appear on the title-pages of any books, she was
almost unknown outside a small provincial circle,
and in that circle no one seems to have had any
idea that there was anything specially remarkable
about her.  Is it likely that such an obscure little
body should have written such admirable books?
Is it not much more likely that they were the work
of Madame d'Arblay, or that in these peaceful
compositions Mrs. Radcliffe found rest and recreation
after the fearful strain on her delicate nervous
system involved in the production of her
"<i>èpouvantable</i>" melodramas?  Jane Austen lays claim
to some of the novels in her letters, it is true,
but, since Ben Jonson's references to Shakespeare,
and all other contemporary evidence in
favour of the Stratford actor's authorship of the
plays have been explained away to the complete
satisfaction of those who dispute his claims, it
would be no very difficult task to persuade a
number of earnest souls that Jane Austen's letters
are not really evidence of her authorship of the
novels.  As for her nearest relations, they were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
not in the real secret.  The secret they are
supposed to have kept during her life was that she
wrote the novels, but if so, where are the MSS.?
Why did not her admiring brothers treasure those
most precious relics?  Two of her MSS. (in addition
to the opening chapters of her final effort in
fiction) her family did, as a fact, preserve, those
of <i>Lady Susan</i> and <i>The Watsons</i>, and these (here
italic type becomes necessary) <i>are so inferior to
the six novels acknowledged, soon after her death,
as hers</i>, that it is easy (if we like) to find it <i>difficult
to believe that they are from the same pen</i>!  The
real secret was that she did not write those six
novels.  This fascinating theory is freely offered
to whomsoever it may please to follow it up.
</p>

<p>
We gain many vivid glimpses of Jane Austen's
views of life in her novels, and <i>Northanger Abbey</i>
holds a place apart from the others, not only for
its many pages of burlesque, but as the vehicle
by which so many of the author's reflections are
conveyed, in a bright wrapping, to her appreciative
readers.  Let me give one or two examples&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"The advantages of natural folly in a beautiful
girl have been already set forth by the capital pen
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
of a sister author; and to her treatment of the
subject I will only add, in justice to men, that
though, to the larger and more trifling part of the
sex, imbecility in females is a great enhancement
of their personal charms, there is a portion of
them too reasonable, and too well-informed
themselves, to desire anything more in woman than
ignorance.  But Catherine did not know her own
advantages&mdash;did not know that a good-looking
girl, with an affectionate heart and a very ignorant
mind, cannot fail of attracting a clever young man,
unless circumstances are particularly untoward."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The sister author is Fanny Burney.  The opinion
of men, the "trifling" or the "reasonable," is Jane
Austen's.  In Henry Tilney's remarks upon Catherine's
extraordinary fears concerning his father's
conduct to Mrs. Tilney we may discover something
of Jane's view of the general condition of
society in her time.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful
nature of the suspicions you have entertained.
What have you been judging from?  Remember
the country and the age in which we live.
Remember that we are English: that we are
Christians.  Consult your own understanding, your own
sense of the probable, your own observation of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
what is passing around you.  Does our education
prepare us for such atrocities?  Do our laws
connive at them?  Could they be perpetrated without
being known, in a country like this, where social
and literary intercourse is on such a footing;
where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood
of voluntary spies; and where roads and
newspapers lay everything open?  Dearest Miss
Morland, what ideas have you been admitting?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Of Jane Austen as humourist there is no need
to write specifically at any length.  Almost every
extract given from her novels, whatever the point
to be illustrated, shows her in that capacity.  It
is impossible for long to separate her humour from
the rest of her qualities.  Yet there are people
who see no humour in her, and actually like her
novels in spite of their "seriousness "!
</p>

<p>
An American author, Mr. Oscar Adams, wrote
a book about her some years ago in order "to
place her before the world as the winsome,
delightful woman that she really was, and thus to
dispel the unattractive, not to say forbidding,
mental picture that so many have formed of her."
Who were these "many" people?  Evidently
they existed (either without or within the author's
own circle) or there would have been no reason
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
to write a book for their conversion.  They were
probably those worthy persons&mdash;we have all met
a few of them ourselves&mdash;who read <i>Emma</i>, and
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, and the rest, without noticing
that a malicious little sprite is for ever peeping
between the lines.  Imagine a reader who regards
all Mr. Bennet's remarks as sober statements of
considered opinion, and you will understand how
Jane Austen might seem formidable.  Though she
is never so ruthless to her characters as
Mr. Bennet is to his wife, Jane is herself a member
of his family.  Perhaps "ruthless" is the wrong
word.  You might apply it to a boy who throws
pebbles at a donkey, but if the object of his attack
was a rhinoceros, the boy would suffer more than
the pachyderm.  To the slings and arrows of her
husband's outrageous humour Mrs. Bennet was
less sensible than was Gulliver to the darts of the
Lilliputians.  Gulliver did feel a pricking
sensation, whereas Mrs. Bennet was merely annoyed
that Mr. Bennet did not always agree with her
mood of the moment.  In his critical introduction
to <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> Professor Saintsbury
forcibly says, in reply to those who resent the
presence of such a husband as Mr. Bennet, that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
Mrs. Bennet was "a quite irreclaimable fool; and
unless he had shot her or himself there was no
way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but
the ironic."  The most unpleasant aspect of
Mr. Bennet's sarcasms is not that they hurt his wife,
which they could not, but that they were heard
by his five daughters, three of whom at least were
more or less able to understand them.
</p>

<p>
Jane Austen the novelist, then, may truly be
"forbidding" to readers who take her <i>au pied de
la lettre</i>.  Such readers are in the position of
Catherine Morland listening to Henry Tilney's
imaginary account of the antiquities and mysteries
of Northanger Abbey.  She went there and painfully
discovered the truth, while they can no more
hope to discover it than a man with one eye can
hope to see things as they appear to his fellows
who have two.  Still, he is a king among the blind,
and the readers who find pleasure in Jane Austen
as an entirely serious author are to be counted
happy as compared with those who cannot read
her at all.
</p>

<p>
It has been said by Mr. Goldwin Smith that
there is no philosophy beneath the surface of Jane
Austen's novels "for profound scrutiny to bring
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
to light," her characters typifying nothing, because
"their doings and sayings are familiar and
commonplace.  Her genius is shown in making the
familiar and commonplace intensely interesting
and amusing."  Such justification as may be
discovered for the charge that the subjects of the
novels are commonplace is chiefly negative in kind.
It is not that we may find in real life innumerable
people as distinctive and entertaining as the principal
characters of these stories, but that Jane does
not introduce us to dramatically unusual scenes
or persons.  There are no houses like Dotheboys
Hall or Ravenswood Tower, no incidents like the
flight of Jos Sedley from Brussels or the arrest of
Vautrin, no strange creatures like Mr. Rochester
or Jonas Chuzzlewit, no scenes like those in
Fagin's kitchen or Shirley's mill.  She was
immediately followed by a humourist whose scenes and
characters are as unusual as hers were familiar.
He is almost unknown to the great fiction-devouring
public, and little read in comparison even
with Jane Austen, with whom he has some strong
affinities as well as antipathies.  Thomas Love
Peacock was never, so happily inspired&mdash;or so
happy perhaps&mdash;as when he was "ironing" the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
insincerity or the unreasonable prejudice of the
"well-to-do" class.  There is, among the parsons
of Jane Austen's creating, none who is more
gloriously diverting than Dr. Ffolliot in <i>Crotchet
Castle</i>, and it is pleasant to imagine Mr. Collins
as curate to that militant theologian.  The talk
of the young women in Peacock's modern novels
is better "informed" and much less natural than
that of Elizabeth Bennet, or Emma, or Anne,
and as for the men, while Mr. Tilney or Mr. Darcy
might not have found it difficult to hold
their own with most of the lovers in Peacock's
novels, his intellectuals&mdash;Milestone, McQueedy,
and the rest&mdash;would have found no one to refute
their arguments among the company at Netherfield
or at Mansfield Park.  Peacock allows his
satirical hobby-horse to run wild over the
bramble-covered desert of British prejudice, while Jane
Austen never leaves go of the rein.  The result
is that while he frequently makes us laugh at
the absurdities of his Scythrops and Chainmails,
whose performances we know to be burlesque, she
makes us chuckle by her silver-shod satire of the
class which she had studied from childhood.  There
are some who read Jane Austen and cannot read
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
Peacock, and the reverse is also true.  Those who
can read both are never likely to be in want of
pleasure on winter evenings so long as mind and
eyes are left.
</p>

<p>
It is certain that no one familiar with either
author could mistake a page written by one of
them for a page by the other.  Jane Austen's
people, in spite of the humour with which the
atmosphere is charged, are always possible&mdash;except,
some of her most intimate admirers say,
for Mr. Collins&mdash;while Peacock was never to be
deterred from breaking through the fence which
borders the pathway of probability.  Only such
readers as the prelate who declined to believe
some of the incidents in <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> could
be expected to regard <i>Melincourt</i> or <i>Nightmare
Abbey</i> as veracious narratives.  For all that
Peacock, whose first novel, <i>Headlong Hall</i>, appeared
in the year (1816) in which Jane Austen's last
(published) work was done, was her immediate
successor as a satirist of the follies and foibles of
English men and women, and he was succeeded
in turn by the splendid Thackeray, whose most
obvious difference from Jane Austen lies in his
frequent indulgence in sentimental reflections.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
</p>

<p>
Jane was amused by the suggestions for improving
her work, or for the plots of fresh novels,
given to her from time to time, and among the
papers found after her death was one endorsed
"Plan of a novel according to hints from various
quarters," the names of some of these human
"quarters" being given in the margin.  There
were to be a "faultless" heroine and her
"faultless" father driven from place to place over
Europe by the vile arts of a "totally unprincipled
and heartless young man, desperately in love with
the heroine, and pursuing her with unrelenting
passion."  Wherever she went somebody fell in
love with her, and she received frequent offers of
marriage, which she referred to her father, who
was "exceedingly angry that he should not be
the first applied to."  The "anti-hero" again and
again carried her off, and she was "now and then
starved to death," but was always rescued either
by her father or the hero!  For even the mildest
varieties of the plots thus burlesqued Jane had
no use, unless to laugh at them.

<p>
In her letters, as in her books, the satiric touch
was on almost everything that Jane Austen wrote.
Her habit of making pithy little notes on the
doings of her acquaintances was, in writing to her
sister, irrepressible.  The pith was not bitter.  It
was just the comment of a highly intelligent
woman to whom the gods had given the gift of
humour, and who, at an age when most girls of
her day were as ingenuous as Evelina or as
Catherine Morland, had learnt how much insincerity
and affectation coloured the conduct even
of kind and well-meaning people.
</p>

<p>
In her references to the foibles of real men and
women we gain many glimpses of the origins&mdash;if
not the originals&mdash;of some of her character studies.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
At an Ashford ball in 1798 one of the Royal
Dukes was present, and among those who supped
in his company were Cassandra and a Mrs. Cage,
with whom the Austens were well acquainted.
This lady was uneasy in the presence of Royalty,
and her mistakes were described in a letter from
Cassandra.  Jane's mention of the incident in her
reply is a fair sample of the way in which, in her
more serious mood, this young woman of twenty-three
regarded the weakness of her less cool and
reasonable friends: "I can perfectly comprehend
Mrs. Cage's distress and perplexity.  She has all
those kind of foolish and incomprehensible
feelings which would make her fancy herself
uncomfortable in such a party.  I love her, however, in
spite of all her nonsense."
</p>

<p>
One can see a hint of Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Bennet
in the silly woman who flustered herself
and fidgeted her companions in her attempts to
assume what she supposed to be the right
behaviour on such an occasion.  Jane, who had never
seen a prince, so far as we know, would have had
no "distress and perplexity."  She would have
curtsied in the prettiest way, the Duke would
have been charmed by her graceful figure, her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
clear complexion, and her soft brown eyes, and
she would next day have written to her sister "all
the minute particulars, which only woman's
language can make interesting."
</p>

<p>
Her reflections on the gossip of the hour are
not always quite so kindly.  When Charles
Powlett (of whose rejected offer of a kiss we have
already heard) brings home a wife, Jane tells her
sister that this bride "is discovered to be
everything that the neighbourhood could wish her, silly
and cross as well as extravagant."  Once, when a
story has reached her in the way that "Russian
Scandal" is played, by the muddling up of
half-understood particulars in the process of
transmission from mouth to ear, she has to correct
a previous statement about some of the Austen
circle&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"On inquiring of Mrs. Clerk, I find that
Mrs. Heathcote made a great blunder in her news of
the Crooks and Morleys.  It is young Mr. Crook
who is to marry the second Miss Morley, and it is
the Miss Morleys instead of the second Miss
Crook who were the beauties at the music
meeting.  This seems a more likely tale, a better
devised imposture."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
</p>

<p>
The sting is where stings usually are.
</p>

<p>
Scandal was as distasteful to her as it can have
been to Madame du Châtelet, of whom Voltaire
said that "<i>tout ce qui occupe la société était de son
ressort, hors la médisance.</i>"  Jane gave Cassandra
many little bits of news about their friends which
the principals might have resented, but between
sister and sister such things are not scandalous,
and as for those who read them now, they may
talk about the incidents referred to as freely as
they like without harm to any one.  Many of the
"scandals" Jane mentions are "serious" only in
her innocent fun.  We hear, for instance, that in
1809, "Martha and Dr. Mant are as bad as ever,
he runs after her in the street to apologize for
having spoken to a gentleman while she was
near him the day before.  Poor Mrs. Mant can
stand it no longer; she is retired to one of her
married daughters."  Jane amused herself and her
sister and teased poor Martha by her jokes on this
affair.  "As Dr. M. is a clergyman," she writes,
"this attachment, however immoral, has a
decorous air."  Mrs. Jennings, Sir John Middleton's
mother-in-law, would have told the story quite
seriously, and with immense gusto, at the Barton
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
breakfast-table, but Dr. Mant and Martha were
not transferred to a novel to the discomfort of
themselves and their families and the delight of
the <i>roman à clef</i> hunters of Southampton.
</p>

<p>
The letters do seem occasionally to bring us
into the company of people whom we know quite
well in the novels.  Jane, replying to Cassandra
at Christmas 1798, says: "I am glad to hear such
a good account of Harriet Bridges; she goes on
now as young ladies of seventeen ought to do,
admired and admiring....  I dare say she
fancies Major Elkington as agreeable as Warren,
and if she can think so, it is very well."  Alter
the surnames, and this passage might apply as
well to Harriet Smith as to Harriet Bridges.  "I
dare say she fancies Mr. Martin as agreeable as
Mr. Churchill, and if she can think so, it is very
well," might have been written by Emma to dear
Anne Weston about the "little friend" from the
boarding-school.  Jane, as in this case of Harriet
Bridges, took so much interest in the love affairs of
her friends that we often think of Emma Woodhouse
and her match-making propensities, about
which Mr. Knightley spoke so harshly.  By
Emma's advice Harriet Smith, having refused
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
Robert Martin, the young farmer, had regarded
Mr. Elton as a prospective husband, and when
he went elsewhere Emma had selected Frank
Churchill for the vacant post.  Then, through a
serious mistake, Mr. Knightley was the man, until
at last the "inconsiderate, irrational, unfeeling"
nature of her conduct became clear to her mind,
and Harriet was allowed to marry the constant
Martin.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Mitford declared that Jane Austen was
husband-hunting at twelve years of age, but the
old lady's memory was evidently quite untrustworthy
about people and dates when she talked
such nonsense.  Jane was, however, on her own
showing, fond of looking out for possible
husbands for her pretty little nieces.  Here is an
instance, from a letter of 1814&mdash;"Young
Wyndham accepts the invitation.  He is such a nice,
gentlemanlike, unaffected sort of young man, that
I think he may do for Fanny."  Next day she is
less pleased with him&mdash;"This young Wyndham
does not come after all; a very long and very civil
note of excuse is arrived.  It makes one moralize
upon the ups and downs of this life."
</p>

<p>
That the habit was hereditary&mdash;it was a custom
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
of Jane's time, even more than it is of our
own&mdash;we may see from a report she sent to Cassandra
of the pleasure with which Mr. and Mrs. Austen,
with one accord, lighted upon a suitable "match"
for their elder daughter.  He was "a beauty of
my mother's."  Having no <i>affaire</i> of her own to
trouble her rest, Jane took an active part as adviser
for those in whose fate she was affectionately
interested.  Especially was this the case with this
favourite niece, Fanny Knight, who, having
fancied she was "in love" with one man,
discovered that she preferred, or thought she
preferred, another.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Do not be in a hurry," wrote Aunt Jane, "the
right man will come at last; you will in the course
of the next two or three years meet with somebody
more generally unexceptionable than anyone you
have yet known, who will love you as warmly
as possible, and who will so completely attract
you that you will feel you never really loved
before."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Fanny, who was "inimitable, irresistible," whose
"queer little heart" and its flutterings were "the
delight of my life," might have been fickle, but she
did not, said her aunt, deserve such a punishment
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P106"></a>106}</span>
as to fall in love after marriage, and with the
wrong man.
</p>

<p>
Jane's views on second marriages are expressed
in the case of Lady Sondes, whose haste to find
consolation after the death of Lord Sondes was
the subject of much chatter among the
Mrs. Jenningses and Mrs. Bennets of her neighbourhood.
"Had her first marriage been of affection,
or had there been a grown-up single daughter, I
should not have forgiven her; but I consider
everybody as having a right to marry once in their lives
for love, if they can, and provided she will now
leave off having bad headaches, and being
pathetic, I can allow her, I can <i>will</i> her, to be
happy."
</p>

<p>
In the novels no woman of consequence&mdash;excepting
the callous and selfish Lady Susan
Vernon&mdash;is allowed a second mate, nor is the
courtship before any of the marriages much in
accord with the general practice of English
fiction.  There is not even a description of some
splendid wedding.  Jane, by the way, did not
regard a marriage as the proper occasion for public
advertisement of the bride's qualities.  "Such a
parade," she writes of the conduct of a certain
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
"alarming bride," is "one of the most immodest
pieces of modesty that one can imagine.  To
attract notice could have been her only wish."
</p>

<p>
It might seem, indeed, that the most original
characteristic of her works is the absence of
almost all the qualities of plot and treatment on
which fiction usually depends for success with the
public.  If we were asked of some modern lady
writer, "What are her books like?" and we
replied, "In one respect they are conventional,
for they all end in the choosing of wedding-rings.
But scarcely anybody in these novels feels the
'grand passion,' they have no relation to current
events, nobody ever has a strange adventure, only
one married woman is faithless to her vows, no
adventuress appears, there are no foreigners, no
one is in revolt against anything, nobody is
seriously troubled about the trend of society or
the decadence of morals and taste, nobody
starves, or commits a murder, or engineers a
swindle, there are no cruel husbands, no triple
<i>ménages</i> and no mysterious occurrences or
detectives, and as nobody dies, nobody makes
death-bed revelations," the retort would probably imply,
"What stupid stuff they must be."  These novels
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
do, indeed, depend for their effect on less of "plot
and passion" than almost any others of consequence
yet written.  There are many novels of
small plot.  Balzac, in <i>Eugénie Grandet</i>, George
Sand, in <i>Tamaris</i>, show what even "stormy"
novelists can do with a modicum of events.  But
the lack of both plot and passion is rare in the
work that lives.  It is thus that the genius of Jane
Austen is strongly displayed.  Only genius could
give a vital, an enduring fascination to a record
chiefly concerned with the ordinary experiences of
a few respectable country people, almost all of
one class.
</p>

<p>
She had the power, because, with the gifts of
expression and of humour, she combined an
almost perfect knowledge of a typical section of
society, all the more clearly exhibited because of
her comparative ignorance of any other section.
She did not care to study the very poor, the very
rich were outside her circle of common experience,
and she would rarely write about people or phases
of life that were not as familiar to her as the
squire's daughter and the manners of the hunt
ball.  She had none of Disraeli's audacity.  "My
son," said Isaac Disraeli, when some one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
expressed surprise at the knowledge of "exalted
circles" shown in <i>The Young Duke</i>, "my son,
sir, when he wrote that book, had never even <i>seen</i>
a duke."  Jane Austen, "never having seen a
duke," or a ducal palace, never attempted to
describe either.  She shrank from any kind of
"lionizing," whether in village society or in the
"great world," and to this healthy pride is no
doubt partly due the obscurity in which she lived
and died.  One instance of her reserve may be
adduced.  Soon after the appearance of
<i>Mansfield Park</i> she was invited, "in the politest
manner," to a party at the house of a nobleman
who suspected her of the authorship of that book,
and who, as an inducement, intimated that she
would be able to converse with Madame de Staël.
"Miss Austen," says her brother, "immediately
declined the invitation.  To her truly delicate
mind such a display would have given pain
instead of pleasure."  The story, which has
sometimes been regarded as evidence of improper
pride on the part of the English novelist, is in
keeping with all that is known of Jane Austen's
nature.
</p>

<p>
Had the meeting of the authors of <i>Emma</i> and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
<i>Corinne</i> come about, one would like to have heard
their conversation.  The talking would have been
largely on one side.  Madame, who knew the
"world," and enjoyed the distinction of having
been called a "wicked schemer" and a "fright"
by the greatest man of her time, would have tried
in vain to impress the unaffected Englishwoman
who cared so little for politics and Napoleon that,
in those novels which Madame regarded as
"<i>vulgaire</i>," she scarcely alluded to either.  Jane
would have listened attentively, and now and
again, when Madame paused for breath, would
have made a polite remark, the covert humour of
which would have been lost on her famous
companion.  There is no suggestion that any hint as
to Madame de Staël's reputation had reached
Chawton Cottage, otherwise some might suppose
that it was not only the diffident modesty Jane's
brother alleges which prevented her from going
to the party.  It is quite likely that she who
described the loves of Lydia Bennet and Maria
Rushworth with such an entire absence of sermonizing
would yet have felt that, though she might
like to converse on a more private occasion with
the author of <i>Corinne</i> and <i>Delphine</i>, she would
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
prefer not to be matched with a lady who had put
to so practical a test her theories "<i>de l'influence
des passions sur le bonheur</i>."
</p>

<p>
Could there be a stronger contrast, physical or
moral, than between the country parson's slight
and good-looking daughter, whose knowledge of
men and affairs was gained in the parlours of
manor-houses and the assembly-rooms of
watering-places, and the financier's stout and ugly
daughter, whose political activities were so
persistent that she had been expelled from Paris,
who had travelled, mingling in the society of the
governing classes, the artists, the men of letters
in Italy, Germany, and other lands, and whose
literary performances, historical, political, and
imaginative, were read wherever educated readers
existed?
</p>

<p>
If Jane had no strong desire to be brought into
contact with the great, wise, and eminent of her
time, neither were her tastes at all in the
direction of social equality or the advocacy of the
"rights of man," and while she was indifferent to
the famous and influential, she was scarcely more
concerned for the obscure and lowly.  Admire
her work as we may, and love her as many of us
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
must, we cannot recognize that she was much
in sympathy with any class but her own.  It is
certainly to no undue regard for social position,
to no want of charitable intention, that we can
attribute her general neglect of the drama, comedy
and tragedy alike, of humble life.  It might be
said that she could, and if she would, have drawn
the poor as well as she drew the "gentry."  She
knew her limitations, and thus such rare sketches of
the "lower orders" as she gives stop short of any
errors of understanding.  Mrs. Reynolds, Darcy's
housekeeper, whose admiration for her master and
his sister is so strongly expressed, and Thomas,
the servant at Barton Cottage, who comes in to
describe how he has seen "Mr. and
Mrs. Ferrars" in Exeter, are in no way out of
drawing, though the phrase with which the author
finishes off the man-servant&mdash;"Thomas and the
table-cloth, now alike needless, were soon
dismissed"&mdash;so aptly suggests the position accorded
to the working classes in her own works that it
almost seems to have a double meaning.  Let any
one familiar with the novels try to recall occasions
when a servant is introduced even in such
common cases as the answering of a bell or waiting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
at table, and he will find it hard to add to the
examples already given any with a better part
than the overworked Nanny at the Watsons', who,
when Lord Osborne is paying his untimely visit,
puts her head in at the door and says, "Please,
ma'am, master wants to know why he be'nt to have
his dinner."  As for the class from which most
of these servants came, it has no place at all.
Emma takes Harriet to a cottage where there is a
convalescent child who requires jellies or beef tea,
but the incident is of no account except as leading
up to the visit to Mr. Elton; and she goes to see
an old servant while Harriet pays her formal call
at the Abbey Mill Farm.  Robert Martin is a
farmer, and a letter from him is introduced, but
he has no share of any consequence in the
dialogue.  When we remember Jane Austen's
avowed partiality for Emma, and Emma's disgust
at the idea of Harriet marrying a mere farmer,
no matter how much her admirer Knightley might
support the man's claims, we may not unreasonably
suppose that Jane to some extent shared
Emma's prejudice.  There was, however, a
notable exception to Jane's remoteness from the
farming class.  The joint tenant of the Manor
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
farm at Steventon, the happily named James
Digweed&mdash;who seems to have been ordained later
on&mdash;was admitted to so much favour that she
could not only dance and dine, and gossip with
him, but could chaff her sister about his evident
desire to gain Cassandra's affection.

Two or three apothecaries are admitted into the
novels.  One attends Jane Bennet at Netherfield,
and another attends Marianne Dashwood at
Cleveland.  Apothecary was almost a term of
contempt in those days, and one of Jane's hits
at the neighbourhood of Hans Place was that
there seemed to be only one person there who was
"not an apothecary."  She even, as we have seen,
corrects her niece for supposing that a country
doctor&mdash;not a mere "apothecary"&mdash;would ever
be "introduced" to a peer!
</p>

<p>
The only country tradesman who figures at all
prominently is Sir William Lucas, who had "risen
to the honour of Knighthood by an address to
the King during his mayoralty.  The distinction
had perhaps been felt too strongly.  It had given
him a disgust to his business....  By nature
inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation
at St. James's had made him courteous."  He is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
not so diverting a creature as Martin Tinman of
Crikswich in Mr. Meredith's delightful comedy
<i>The House on the Beach</i>, who, when rescued
from that storm-beaten home on a terrible night,
was found to be wearing the Court suit in which,
long before, he had presented an address to the
throne!  But Sir William Lucas's constant
recollection of the fact that <i>he</i> had been received by
the sovereign, while his neighbours, the "small"
country-gentlemen, had not, is illustrated with
admirable art.  In his "emporium," with his
stock-in-trade around him, his portrait would
never have been drawn.  Mr. Weston also made
money in trade, apparently "in the wholesale
line," after he had retired from the militia, and
of the proud and conceited Bingley sisters we are
told that "they were of a respectable family in
the north of England; a circumstance more
deeply impressed on their memories than that
their brother's fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade."
</p>

<p>
Jane has many kindly things to tell her sister
about, her mother's maids, especially of a faithful
and industrious "Nannie."  Of the maids' relations,
the agricultural class, amid whose homes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
she passed nearly all her life, she has, as I have
said, left no account in her novels.  Her letters
do indeed contain many bits of news concerning
the ploughmen and washerwomen of the parish,
and they are significant as to the manner, proper
to the age, in which she regarded her humble
neighbours.  Her references to the cottagers are
commonly devoid of any indication of deeper
feeling than the consciousness of a need to give
them clothes.  Of the people employed on her
father's farm, she says&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"John Bond begins to find himself grow old,
which John Bond ought not to do, and unequal
to much hard work; a man is therefore hired to
supply his place as to labour, and John himself
is to have the care of the sheep.  There are not
more people engaged than before, I believe; only
men instead of boys.  I fancy so at least, but
you know my stupidity as to such matters.  Lizzie
Bond is just apprenticed to Miss Small, so we may
hope to see her able to spoil gowns in a few years."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
About Christmas (1798) she writes&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Of my charities to the poor since I came home
you shall have a faithful account.  I have given
a pair of worsted stockings to Mary Hutchins,
Dame Kew, Mary Steevens, and Dame Staples;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
a shift to Hannah Staples, and a shawl to Betty
Dawkins, amounting in all to about half-a-guinea.
But I have no reason to suppose that the <i>Battys</i>
would accept of anything, because I have not
made them the offer."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Of personal service we hear but little.  There
is just the old "Lady Bountiful" idea, adapted
to the purse of the parson's younger daughter.
Alms were what the poor chiefly wanted, and alms
they received&mdash;if not in money, in warm garments.
She gave them worsted stockings, and flannel to
wear in the cold weather.  She did not often, so
far as we hear, sit and chat with Dame Staples
and Dame Kew over the things that made up their
life-interests, or listen to the confidences of Lizzie
Bond and Hannah Staples concerning their rustic
lovers.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we do hear of talks with poor
women, as when Jane writes, "I called yesterday
upon Betty Londe, who inquired particularly after
you, and said she seemed to miss you very much,
because you used to call in upon her very often.
This was an oblique reproach at me, which I am
sorry to have merited, and from which I will
profit."  We may well believe that Jane was no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
pioneer in "district visiting."  Her services to
humanity were of another kind.  Almost alone
among the greater novelists who have written the
fiction of drawing-rooms, she was hardly less
indifferent as a writer to the concerns of the
governing class of her day than of the voteless class,
unless, indeed, she was a hostile witness so far
as her knowledge went.  Among the worst-bred
persons in the novels, with John Thorpe, Mr. Collins,
and the ever-delightful Mrs. Bennet, are
Sir Walter Elliot and Lady Catherine de Bourgh,
and the hero whose manners are most open to
reproach is Lady Catherine's nephew, Darcy&mdash;before
he has been refused by Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
Jane Austen's views on the claims of social
position, as distinct from individual character,
were much the same as Anne Elliot's.  Mr. Elliot
and Anne, we learn&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Did not always think alike.  His value for
rank and connection she perceived to be greater
than hers.  It was not merely complaisance, it
must be a liking to the cause, which made him
enter warmly into her father's and sister's
solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to
excite them....  She was reduced to form a wish
which she had never foreseen&mdash;a wish that they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
had more pride....  Had Lady Dalrymple and
her daughter even been very agreeable, she would
still have been ashamed of the agitation they
created; but they were nothing.  There was no
superiority of manner, accomplishment, or
understanding."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Dalrymples and Lady Catherine de
Bourgh do not lead one to suppose that Jane's
acquaintance with their class was a fortunate one.
Had it been, she would probably have given some
happier examples of the titular aristocracy.  Lord
Osborne, in <i>The Watsons</i>, is in some ways a more
amiable type, but too "sketchy" to be of much
account as an antidote to such unpleasing people
as the aunt of Darcy and the cousins of Anne
Elliot.
</p>

<p>
If persons of artificial eminence are almost
unknown in the novels, there is an even more
complete dearth of men or women distinguished
for their individual gifts or achievements.  Sir
John Middleton fills his too hospitable mansion
with an endless supply of guests who keep his
maid-servants hard at work in preparing spare
bedrooms, that were occupied the night before, for
fresh arrivals in the afternoon.  He hardly allows
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
time to speed the parting guests before he must
turn to welcome their successors.  But no statesman,
or traveller, or professor, not so much as a
rising politician or a poet, crosses those ever-open
doors.  They do not come, for one reason&mdash;and
it seems a sufficient one&mdash;because they scarcely
exist for the author, or if they do, the people who
eat mutton and drink port and Madeira around the
mahogany tables at Netherfield, or Barton, or
Uppercross, know and care nothing whatever
about them and their performances.  "Each
thinks his little set mankind" is as true of the
characters in Jane Austen's books as in a sense
it is true, one is sometimes inclined to think, of
their author.  The Morlands, and Musgroves,
and Woodhouses, and Bennets have never
travelled, unless an occasional visit to London
may count as travel.  They have been into some
neighbouring county, they have been perchance to
Bath.  They have not so much as been to Paris.
Emma had never seen the sea.  Twenty years
earlier it would have been different.  Darcy at
any rate would have known something of France
had he been twenty years older.  From the
outbreak of the Revolution till the first exile of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
Napoleon, France was not a likely place for any
but the most adventurous of squires to choose for
a pleasure-trip, nor, after the rise of Napoleon's
star, were the accessible parts of the Continent
very attractive for any but soldiers of fortune
and spies.  Thus, not only are the conversations
which Jane Austen offers devoid of any such
elements of interest as are introduced, for example,
by the appearance of Byron in <i>Venetia</i>, or of
Shelley in <i>Nightmare Abbey</i>, but the opportunities
of lively talk offered by reminiscences of
foreign manners and scenes are not allowed to the
author.  On the other hand, we do not meet with
any of those egotistical travellers who, as a
contemporary of Jane Austen's declared, "If you
introduce the name of a river or a hill, instantly
deluge you with the <i>Rhine</i>, or make you dizzy
with the height of <i>Mont Blanc</i>."
</p>

<p>
In any case, however much the fact may be due
to want of opportunities for enlarging her
knowledge, Jane, literature apart, took very little
interest in anything outside the social and family
life of her own class in the country.  Her
published correspondence has been described as
"trivial" (as her novels have been, for that is what
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
Madame de Staël meant by "<i>vulgaire</i>," and not
"vulgar," as Sir James Mackintosh and others
have supposed), and, in comparison with such
contemporary letters as Byron's or Lamb's, her
accounts of her dances and her bonnets are
certainly weak tea for serious readers.  They are,
however, exactly such letters as she might have
been expected to write.  Her satire gives them
an agreeable tartness which somehow suggests
the syllabubs which were so common a feature of
the supper-tables of her time.  It is all, one may
reasonably suppose, like the common talk of the
drawing-room in a manor-house on an afternoon
when the men are hunting or shooting&mdash;the choice
of a winter frock, the prospects of a ball at some
territorial magnate's, the errors of cooks and
housemaids, the fatuity of this young man who
is so rich, and the silliness of that young woman
who is so pretty&mdash;enlivened by Jane's wit.
</p>

<p>
The dances, whether full-dress balls or merely
"small and early hops" were among the favourite
pleasures of Jane Austen.  If you have read her
letters you will feel that she is present when
Fanny Price dances so prettily at Mansfield
Park, or when Darcy declines to dance with
Elizabeth because though she is "tolerable," she is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
"not handsome enough" to tempt him.  "I
danced twice with Warren last night, and once
with Mr. Charles Watkins, and to my inexpressible
astonishment I entirely escaped John
Lyford.  I was forced to fight hard for it,
however.  We had a very good supper, and the
greenhouse was illuminated in a very elegant
manner."  Such bits of news are common at all
periods of Jane's correspondence.  For example:
"The ball on Thursday was a very small one
indeed, hardly so large as an Oxford smack;"
and again, "Our ball on Thursday was a very
poor one, only eight couple, and but twenty-three
people in the room"&mdash;just as it was when they
got up the scratch dance at the Bertrams, "the
thought only of the afternoon, built on the late
acquisition of a violin player in the servants' hall."
</p>

<p>
On another occasion, at a public hall at the
county town&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"The Portsmouths, Dorchesters, Boltons,
Portals, and Clerks were there, and all the meaner
and more usual etc., etcs.  There was a scarcity
of men in general, and a still greater scarcity of
any that were good for much.  I danced nine
dances out of ten&mdash;five with Stephen Terry,
T. Chute, and James Digweed, and four with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
Catherine.  There was commonly a couple of
ladies standing up together, but not often any so
amiable as ourselves."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Jane, from all we know of her, would almost
as soon dance with another girl as with a man&mdash;it
was the dancing she loved, and watching the
behaviour of others, their flirtations, their
love-making, their airs and affectations.
</p>

<p>
Emma Woodhouse, the day after a dance at
Highbury, might have sent to her sister in
Brunswick Square just such an account as Jane Austen
to her sister at Godmersham&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"There were very few beauties, and such as
there were were not very handsome."  One of the
girls seemed to her: "A queer animal with a white
neck.  Mrs. Warren, I was constrained to think a
very fine young woman, which I much regret.  She
danced away with great activity.  Her husband is
ugly enough, uglier even than his cousin John;
but he does not look so <i>very</i> old.  The Miss
Maitlands are both prettyish, very like Anne, with
brown skins, large dark eyes, and a good deal of
nose.  The General has got the gout, and
Mrs. Maitland the jaundice."
</p>

<p>
A ball to which Jane Austen went in 1808&mdash;her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
thirty-fourth year&mdash;was "rather more amusing"
than she expected.  "The melancholy part was
to see so many dozen young women standing by
without partners, and each of them with two ugly
naked shoulders.  It was the same room in which
we danced fifteen years ago.  I thought it all over,
and in spite of the shame of being so much older,
felt with thankfulness that I was quite as happy
now as then.  We paid an additional shilling for
our tea."  This letter is but one of many bits of
evidence that no memory of a Captain Wentworth
troubled Jane's own life.  The "shame" such a
woman could have felt in being "older" one can
scarcely imagine, and the context shows it was
not seriously felt.
</p>

<p>
The most pathetic dancing incident in the
novels was the impromptu affair at Uppercross
(in <i>Persuasion</i>), where Anne saw her old lover
apparently losing his heart elsewhere.  "The
evening ended with dancing.  On its being
proposed, Anne offered her services, as usual; and
though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears
as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely
glad to be employed, and desired nothing in
return but to be unobserved."  She did not know
that Wentworth, who was making so merry with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
the Musgrove girls, was faithful all the time to
his old love&mdash;herself.  We might doubt whether
the author knew it until later on in the story,
were it not that the idea of ending a novel
without the marriage of the principal maiden to the
man she liked best would have been entirely
foreign to Jane Austen's method.  So Frederick
Wentworth danced with the Musgroves, and
Anne played for their delight.
</p>

<p>
The dance most fully described was that given
by the Westons at the "Crown," when Mr. Elton
behaved so abominably to Harriet Smith, and
Mr. Knightley showed himself a <i>preux chevalier</i> and
saved Emma's lovely <i>protégée</i> from the humiliation
of being the only "wallflower."  In describing
how Elizabeth at Netherfield, Catherine at
Bath, Harriet at Highbury, and Fanny at
Mansfield Park idly watched the dancing because no
man had asked them to join it, Jane, pretty girl
and excellent dancer as she was, spoke from
personal experience.  Once at any rate, when "in
the pride of youth and beauty," she was able to
write, after a dance at a neighbouring house&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"I do not think I was very much in request.
People were rather apt not to ask me till they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
could not help it; one's consequence, you know,
varies so much at times without any particular
reason.  There was one gentleman, an officer of
the Cheshire, a very good-looking young man,
who, I was told, wanted very much to be
introduced to me; but as he did not want it quite
enough to take much trouble in effecting it, we
never could bring it about."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She would not, if she could help it, dance with
bad partners.  "One of my gayest actions," she
writes after a ball, "was sitting down two dances
in preference to having Lord Bolton's eldest son
for my partner, who danced too ill to be endured."
</p>

<p>
It is in connection with one of the Westons'
parties that Mr. Woodhouse makes his sage
observations on the eternal question of ventilation.
When Frank Churchill says that the fresh air
difficulty will be settled by their dancing in a large
room, so that the windows need not be opened,
because "it is that dreadful habit of opening the
windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies,
which does the mischief," Mr. Woodhouse cries&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"'Open the windows! but surely, Mr. Churchill,
nobody would think of opening the windows
at Randalls.  Nobody could be so imprudent!  I
never heard of such a thing.  Dancing with open
windows!  I am sure neither your father nor
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would
suffer it.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'Ah! sir&mdash;but a thoughtless young person will
sometimes step behind a window-curtain, and
throw up a sash, without its being suspected.  I
have often known it done myself.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'Have you, indeed, sir?  Bless me!  I never
could have supposed it.  But I live out of the
world, and am often astonished at what I hear.'"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The conversation of this valetudinarian quietist
is always diverting.  He suggests that Emma
should leave the Coles' party before it is half over,
as it is so bad to be up late.  "But, my dear sir,"
cried Mr. Weston, "if Emma comes away early
it will be breaking up the party."
</p>

<p>
"And no great harm if it does," said Mr. Woodhouse.
"The sooner every party breaks up the
better."
</p>

<p>
Advancing maturity did not do much to spoil
Jane's love of dances.  From Southampton, in
1809, she wrote: "Your silence on the subject
of our ball makes me suppose your curiosity too
great for words.  We were very well entertained,
and could have stayed longer but for the arrival
of my list shoes to convey me home, and I did
not like to keep them waiting in the cold."

If Jane tells Cassandra about her own dances,
she is ever ready in return for news of Cassandra's.
"I shall be extremely anxious to hear the event
of your ball, and shall hope to receive so long
and minute an account of every particular that I
shall be tired of reading it....  We were at a
ball on Saturday I assure you.  We dined at
Goodnestone and in the evening danced two
country dances and the Boulangeries."  This
French dance, by the way, was on the unwritten
programme at Mr. Bingley's ball, in <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i>.  It seems to have had its birth in
the Revolution, when the bakers, men and women
together, kept themselves warm by joining hands
and dancing up and down the streets.
</p>

<p>
After Jane Fairfax had sung herself hoarse at
the Coles' party&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"The proposal of dancing&mdash;originating nobody
exactly knew where&mdash;was so effectually promoted
by Mr. and Mrs. Cole that everything was rapidly
clearing away, to give proper space.  Mrs. Weston,
capital in her country dances, was seated, and
beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank
Churchill, coming up with most becoming
gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand, and led
her up to the top, (where) she led off the dance
with genuine spirit and enjoyment."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
</p>

<p>
The waltz was a novelty still in those days, and
seems here to be classed as a country dance.  It
had been imported from Germany, where Mozart
had done much to forward its triumph, after Jane
Austen had written her earlier novels, and I cannot
remember any other reference to it in her work.
It was at first considered an "improper" dance,
and one need not be surprised that a generation
which had danced nothing more intimate than the
"boulangeries" was at first a little flustered by the
new fashion.  Sheridan, watching the dancers in
a ball-room, repeated the following lines of his
own composition, which aptly suggest the contrast
between the old dancing and the new as it struck
the eyes of our great-grand-aunts about the time
when Emma danced at the "Crown" and Jane
Austen at Goodnestone.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "With tranquil step, and timid, downcast glance,<br />
  Behold the well-paired couple now advance.<br />
  In such sweet posture our first parents moved,<br />
  While, hand in hand, through Eden's bowers they roved,<br />
  Ere yet the Devil, with promise fine and false,<br />
  Turn'd their poor heads, and taught them how to waltz."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Little wonder, when a waltz was regarded as
forbidden fruit, if Edmund Bertram, Fanny, and
Sir Thomas were shocked at the very idea of
play-acting by the family and guests at Mansfield Park.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
Not that there were wanting plenty of quiet souls
who were in nowise personally distressed at the
"impropriety" of the waltz on their own account,
just as, in the other matter of amateur theatricals,
and the choice of a play, when Lady Bertram
asked her children not to "act anything improper,"
it was not because she had any personal objection
to offer, but because "Sir Thomas would not
like it."
</p>

<p>
The Bertrams' ill-fated theatricals, and the
waltz which Mrs. Weston played, serve to
emphasize the place which Jane Austen fills as an
historian of the transition from the formal prudery
of the sceptical eighteenth century to the broader
liberties of the scientific nineteenth.  "What is
become of all the shyness in the world?" she
asks her sister in 1807; "shyness and the
sweating sickness have given way to confidence and
paralytic complaints."  Morals change but little
as compared with <i>moeurs</i>.  The girls who act in
private theatricals every winter and dance twenty
waltzes a night half the year round are no whit
less virtuous than their great-grandmothers who
were shocked at the waltz, and caught cold in
clothes which were so thin that, as a close observer
has recorded, you could "see the gleam of their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
garter-buckles" through the silks and kerseymeres
as they danced, and altogether so suitable
for a classical revival that a contemporary poet
was moved to utter the quatrain&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When dressed for the evening the girls now-a-days,<br />
  Scarce an atom of dress on them leave;<br />
  Nor blame them, for what is an evening dress<br />
  But a dress that is suited to Eve."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Thus the mother of mankind is accused by one
poet of having danced the first waltz, and held
responsible by another for the airy fashions of the
Récamier period.
</p>

<p>
One of the principal differences of etiquette, we
may note before passing on, between the customs
of the ball-room a century ago and now, was that
in the days when John Lyford was eluded with
so much difficulty a girl danced two successive
dances with the same partner as a matter of course,
so that neither an imaginary John Thorpe nor a
real John Lyford could be got rid of by the
promise of one dance.
</p>

<p>
The scraps from the letters, given on the last
few pages, help us to realize how clearly Jane
Austen's own life is at times reflected in her books.

<p class="intro">
Dr. Whately on Jane Austen&mdash;"Moral lessons" of her
novels&mdash;Charge of "Indelicacy"&mdash;Marriage as a
profession&mdash;A "problem" novel&mdash;"The Nostalgia of the
Infinite"&mdash;The "whitewashing" of Willoughby&mdash;<i>Lady

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The moral lessons of this lady's novels," wrote
Archbishop Whately in his <i>Quarterly</i> article of
1821, "though clearly and impressively conveyed,
are not offensively put forward, but spring
incidentally from the circumstances of the story."  So
inoffensively, indeed, are they offered to our
notice, that Dr. Whately himself seems to have
been unable to discover them at all.  "On the
whole," writes the Archbishop, "Miss Austin's (<i>sic</i>)
works may safely be recommended, not only as
among the most unexceptionable of their class, but
as combining, in an eminent degree, instruction
with amusement, though without the direct effort
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
at the former, of which we have complained, as
sometimes defeating its object."
</p>

<p>
The most obvious "moral" of Jane Austen's
novels is that if you are a heroine you need not
trouble yourself about your future.  You are
certain to marry a worthy man with an income
sufficient for a comfortable existence.  He may be
endowed with something less than a thousand
a year, like Edward Ferrars, with a couple of
thousand like Captain Wentworth, or with the
ten thousand a year which made Darcy appear so
admirable to Mrs. Bennet.  In any case you will
not have to eat bread-and-scrape or go without a
fire in your bedroom.  The Country-house Comedy
of Jane Austen is full of morals if you are in need
of them, but it was not written to improve you,
only to amuse you&mdash;and its maker.  If you must
have a clear moral for each story, after the manner
of tracts, you may take them thus.  <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i> conveys the useful lesson that the
person you most dislike in one month may be the
one you will very sensibly give your affection to
in the next; <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> that when the
bad man falls into the pit he has dug for himself,
the good man comes by his own; <i>Emma</i> that the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
man whose society is most necessary to a woman's
quiet contentment is the man she ought to marry;
<i>Mansfield Park</i> that a simple, unaffected girl who
gains the second place in a man's affections may
win the prize through the disqualification of her
more brilliant rival; <i>Persuasion</i> that nothing is
more likely to revive an old passion than to see
its object warmly admired by some other eligible
party; <i>Northanger Abbey</i> that a tuft-hunting
father may be induced to receive a daughter-in-law
of no importance by the kindly influence of a
son-in-law of superior rank.  As for <i>Lady Susan</i>,
the moral of that unpleasing story is that if a
worldly <i>mater pulchra</i> is the rival in love of an
ingenuous <i>filia pulchrior</i> she will probably lose
the battle after much suffering on either side; and
from <i>The Watsons</i> we may see that if a girl is
educated above her family she will find it hard
to be happy beside the domestic hearth.  All
these are plain workable morals.  Whether the
author of the novels would have endorsed them
we cannot certainly know, but it is more than
probable she would not.
</p>

<p>
We need not suppose that Jane Austen was
ignorant of the coarseness of conversation, the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
hard-drinking, the wild gambling, the moral laxity
of a large section of society that are so frequently
exhibited in the records of the age, in spite of
the improvement in manners.  But we can hardly
help laughing at the objection taken to her novels
even by some of her contemporaries, that they
were "indelicate"!  The "indelicacy" was usually
found in the views of marriage held and expressed
by the heroines and their families.  The
love-affairs of these country maidens were not often,
we must admit, such as to steal away their beauty
sleep or spoil their appetites for breakfast.
Mrs. Jennings' kindly endeavour to cure a girl's
disappointment in love by a variety of sweetmeats
and olives, and a good fire, was perhaps not
wholly unjustified by experience.  In those days,
when no profession save that of governess was
open to women, when nursing the sick was
regarded as an occupation specially suitable for
those of a low class, when no door opened from
the drawing-room on to the professional stage, and
when the very idea of a "female" as secretary to
a man of affairs or of business would have been
condemned as "improper," marriage was
undoubtedly viewed by most people as the only aim
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
of a young woman, "the pleasantest preservative
from want," as Charlotte Lucas regarded it, and,
moreover, the average age of brides was much
lower than it is now-a-days.  To avoid being a
governess by attracting the admiration of a man
who could afford a wife was the hope, at least, of
most poorly endowed girls, and even if matrimony
is not viewed with so much sentiment and reserve
by Jane Austen's heroines as by the excessively
squeamish Evelina, we may be inclined to prefer
the "indelicacy" of Jane Austen to the elaborate,
delicacy of Fanny Burney.  Scott himself, by an
ingenious paradox, has been accused&mdash;as a
novelist&mdash;of immorality, and <i>Quentin Durward</i> in
particular described as "one of the most immoral
novels that has even been written," because its
romance expresses nothing.  The interest a boy
takes in its romantic passages "depends on the
fact that he dreams himself to be in similar
circumstances; he must treat the novel subjectively,
and it is the subjective use of the imagination
which does all the damage.  It is in reading such
books as this that a bad habit of mind is begun,
and <i>Quentin Durward</i> is more immoral for a boy
of fourteen than a translation of the most
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
shockingly indecent French novel."  Well may the
anonymous writer of this unexpected criticism
add: "There are paradoxes to be met everywhere,
and most of all in the question of morality."  This
particular kind of immorality has not yet, so far
as I know, been charged against Jane Austen.  She
cannot be justly accused of writing romance which
"expresses nothing," but she certainly leaves
plenty of opportunity for young readers to
exercise their imaginations, and thus begin a "bad
habit of mind."
</p>

<p>
The view of marriage as a profession, with or
without ardent affection, is not the only thing that
has shocked the delicacy of many of Jane Austen's
readers.  Serious objection has been taken to her
introduction of episodes of an "improper" nature.
How is the charge supported?  Lydia Bennet, a
vulgar, badly brought-up girl still in her teens,
infatuated with the red coats of the militia officers,
insists on going away with Wickham, and lives
with him as his mistress until, by the generous aid
of Darcy, and the determination of the Gardiners&mdash;her
uncle and aunt&mdash;"a marriage is arranged"
and does "shortly take place."  This episode, say
the stern critics, was (1) unnecessary to the plot,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
and (2) if it was necessary, it is too much insisted
on and developed.  That it is an essential part of
the little plot, worked in to exhibit the best side
of Darcy's character, which before has only been
seen in its least attractive light, seems to me
obvious, and I agree with Professor Saintsbury's
opinion that it brings about the <i>dénouement</i> with
complete propriety.  Lydia's entire indifference to
the moral aspect of her conduct is and was unusual
in a girl of sixteen and of her class, but her
character from first to last is consistently drawn, and
the contrast between the selfishness of Wickham
and Lydia, who care nothing for any one's
happiness except their own, and not even for each
other's, and the sympathy of heart and variety of
temperament which bring Elizabeth and Darcy
together is admirably drawn.
</p>

<p>
Then we are asked to be shocked at the illustration
of the bad character and selfish cruelty of
Willoughby given to Elinor Dashwood by the
very worthy and very dull Colonel Brandon in
<i>Sense and Sensibility</i>.  It is a painful story.
Willoughby, the faithless lover of Marianne
Dashwood, had seduced an impressionable girl whom
Brandon, out of affection for the memory of her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
mother, herself ruined by a scoundrel, had
practically adopted, and whom such scandal-mongers as
Mrs. Jennings declared to be the Colonel's own
child.  "Why drag in this nasty story?" ask the
objectors, and above all, "why allow the Colonel
to pour it into the ears of a young girl like
Elinor?"  That it comes unfortunately from
Brandon, who is a rival&mdash;hopeless as it had
seemed&mdash;of Willoughby for Marianne's affection,
and that in the middle-class society of to-day a
well-bred man would not tell such a tale to a
girl if he could find any other means of achieving
an imperative object is undeniable.
</p>

<p>
What was Brandon to do?  He knew that
Marianne was pining for love of a man at least
as unworthy of her as, in his worst days, was Tom
Jones of Sophia, and he believed, with or without
reason, that the knowledge of Willoughby's character
would be a bitter but efficacious medicine for
her heart-sickness.  Elinor, the sensible, prudent,
devoted sister, seemed the only person to whom
he could tell the story with any hope that it would
be discreetly used.  "He had spent many hours
in convincing himself that he was right," and
when Elinor said, "I understand you, you have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby that will
open his character farther.  Your telling it will
be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown
to Marianne.  My gratitude will be ensured
immediately by any information tending to that end,
and hers must be gained by it in time.  Pray,
pray let me hear it," there is little reason for
wonder that "upon this hint he spake," and told
the story of the moral ruin of the mother and the
cruel desertion of the daughter which the reader
of <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> will recall, Elinor lost
little time in retailing it to her sister, with the
immediate and apparently unexpected effect of
increasing the girl's unhappiness.  "She felt the
loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily
than she had felt the loss of his heart," though we
know that she soon afterwards became as fond
a wife of Colonel Brandon as she ever could have
been of Willoughby.
</p>

<p>
Far more remarkable, I think, than Brandon's
telling Elinor the miserable story of his sister-in-law
and her daughter is the manner in which
Elinor herself receives Willoughby's attempt to
excuse his conduct.  He admits his treatment of
Miss Williams, but asks how Elinor could think
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
Colonel Brandon an impartial reporter of the
affair, and proceeds to offer his own excuse in
the words that follow&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"I do not mean to justify myself, but at the
same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have
nothing to urge,&mdash;that because she was injured,
she was irreproachable,&mdash;and because I was a
libertine, she must be a saint.  If the violence of
her passion, the weakness of her understanding&mdash;I
do not mean, however, to defend myself.  Her
affection for me deserved better treatment, and I
often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness
which, for a very short time, had the power
of creating any return.  I wish&mdash;I heartily wish
it had never been.  But I have injured more than
herself; and I have injured one whose affection
for me (may I say it?) was scarcely less warm
than hers, and whose mind&mdash;oh! how infinitely
superior."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In other words, the inexperienced child was of
weak understanding, and loved him passionately,
and therefore he was not so much to blame as if
she had been less warm in her affection and
stronger in her intelligence.  Surely the reasoning
should have been reversed.  Yet after this fine
oration Elinor "pities" him, and, when he goes
on to disparage his wife, whom he has married for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
her fortune, and to express his continued love for
Marianne, all that Elinor says is, "You are very
wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable, you ought
not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby
or my sister," and in saying this "her voice, in
spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate
emotion."  When he left her, Elinor assured him
that she thought better of him than she had done,
"that she forgave, pitied him, wished him well&mdash;was
even interested in his happiness&mdash;and added
some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most
likely to promote it;" counsel which he showed
little disposition to take.
</p>

<p>
This tolerance by Elinor for a man who, on
his own admission, had "taken advantage" of a
simple young girl, ignorant in the world's ways,
this readiness to allow extenuating circumstances
to a mercenary breaker of reputations and hearts,
is a far more serious fact than the mere
introduction of a story which does fit quite easily
into the plan of the novel.  Elinor's reflections
when Willoughby had ended his apologies sufficiently
show that the point of view suggested in
the duologue between the sinner and the sister
was deliberately set up by the author&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
"She made no answer.  Her thoughts were
silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too
early an independence and its consequent habits
of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in
the mind, the character, the happiness, of a man
who, to every advantage of person and talents,
united a disposition naturally open and honest,
and a feeling, affectionate temper.  The world had
made him extravagant and vain; extravagance
and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish.
Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the
expense of another, had involved him in a real
attachment, which extravagance, or at least its
offspring necessity, had required to be sacrificed.
Each faulty propensity, in leading him to evil, had
led him likewise to punishment.  The attachment
from which, against honour, against feeling, against
every better interest he had outwardly torn
himself, now, when no longer allowable, governed
every thought; and the connection, for the sake of
which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to
misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness
to himself of a far more incurable nature."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The chapter describing this interview between
Willoughby and Elinor is the only one in all the
novels of Jane Austen wherein a "problem," after
the kind dear to the dramatist of to-day and the
novelists of yesterday, is fully presented and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
considered, the heroines, with this exception,
answering to Mr. Andrew Lang's description, being
"ignorant of evil, as it seems, and unacquainted
with vain yearnings and interesting doubts."  Elinor
only, as we find her on this occasion, is a
pioneer of that school of sociology which
whitewashes the individual at the expense of his early
environment and education.  Her defence of this
wretched man is, in principle, that which an Old
Bailey advocate offers when he cites the theories
of Lombroso in favour of a beetle-browed criminal
who has stuck his knife into the breast of some
confiding woman.  It was "the world" that had
made him what he was, he was to be pitied, not
condemned.
</p>

<p>
Though we have not to consider here whether
Elinor and the advocate are right or wrong, it is
hard to avoid the thought that, when she wrote this
remarkable chapter, Jane Austen was influenced
in a degree quite unusual in that age with people
of her class by the sense of futility which, not long
before her day, had been the motive of <i>Candide</i>.
Voltaire's irony is bitter, in spite of the optimism
which his book preaches, and of the essential kindness
of his nature, while Jane Austen's is as sweet
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
as irony can ever be.  That she was intentionally
ironical in this case of Elinor's tolerance is
scarcely possible.  Only a cynic would treat a
pure-minded maiden's apology for a heartless
seducer as a subject for covert satire, and Jane
was not a cynic.
</p>

<p>
Writing of Maria Edgeworth in his <i>Notes for
a Diary</i>, Sir M. E. Grant Duff says: "In her, as
in Miss Austen, there is something wanting.  Is it
what has been called the <i>nostalgie de l'Infini</i>?"  That
intellectual ailment is more common now-a-days
than it was in the eighteenth century, and
there was little of it in the grey matter of any
country brains when Jane was born.  Certainly it
cannot be diagnosed from her work generally.
Only in the particular case of Elinor and
Willoughby does that idea of the helplessness of man
in the maelstrom of Infinity which has paralyzed
the wills of so many unhappy victims, and induced
the devastating literature of determinism, seem to
have entered into her plan of work&mdash;for only
thus can I account for the moral whitewashing of
Willoughby, not by a "man-of-the-world," with
his "after all," and his "human nature"
arguments, but by a country ingénue.  The more I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
read Jane Austen's writings the stronger grows
my conviction that she was one of those fortunate
beings whose optimism is differentiated from
pessimism by the good offices of an excellent
digestion and an even pulse.
</p>

<p>
We need not suppose that she had thought
much about the philosophical sanction of conduct
as opposed to the purely religious, or that she had
studied the French <i>Encyclopædia</i>.  She was
born and brought up in an atmosphere wherein
convention, in regard to the things that matter,
was almost omnipotent, and she was not of the
type whereof iconoclasts are made.  She attacked
no system, social or religious; but she had no
fondness for "isms," and thus it is that dogmatism
is quite as hard to discover in her writings as
scepticism.
</p>

<p>
It has been said already that Jane Austen was
not a cynic.  Yet it would be easy, by making
<i>Lady Susan</i> one's text, and ignoring the rest of
her writings, to show that she was as cynical as a
Swift or an Anatole France.  Of course I do not
mean that her apparent cynicism in this case was
exercised on the kind of subjects which is
ridiculed in <i>The Tale of a Tub</i> or in <i>L'Ile des
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
Pingouins</i>.  But I know nothing, in its way, more
cold-blooded in the presentation of "love" than
the conclusion of that novel of Jane's springtime,
which she herself, her own wise critic, withheld
from publication.  The rivalry of mother and
daughter for the affections of the same man must
always be an unpleasant subject, and the story of
the conflict between Lady Susan Vernon and her
daughter for the matrimonial prize represented by
Reginald de Courcy, as told in letters among the
characters concerned, is on a low plane.  The
morals of the "heroine" may not be suspect, but
her tone is below suspicion.
</p>

<p>
What is the <i>dénouement</i> of <i>Lady Susan</i>?  The
mother's schemes to marry the man of the
daughter's choice have ended in her own marriage
to the wealthy noodle whom she had tried to force
upon the daughter.  "Frederica," says the
author,&mdash;dropping the "correspondence" plan in order to
wind up the book more readily&mdash;"was therefore
fixed in the family of her uncle and aunt till such
time as Reginald de Courcy could be talked, flattered
and finessed into an affection for her which,
allowing leisure for the conquest of his attachment
to her mother, for his abjuring all future
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
attachments, and detesting the sex, might be
reasonably looked for in the course of a
twelve-month.  Three months might have done it in
general, but Reginald's feelings were no less
lasting than lively.  Whether Lady Susan was or was
not happy in her second choice, I do not see how
it can ever be ascertained...."
</p>

<p>
It is certain that to some considerable extent
<i>Lady Susan</i> was a satire on several lady novelists
of the period.  All Jane Austen's novels are more
or less satirical, from <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, which is
full of burlesque passages, to <i>Persuasion</i>, in which
they are so rare that it needs a hunt to discover
any.  Whether or not <i>Lady Susan</i> was intended
to be taken more seriously than in jest, it is a dull
performance.  The whole plan and treatment of
the book are artificial.  It was not Jane's natural
instinct or her finer art which was at work in its
making.  So foreign is it to herself that if the
MS. had been found in some cupboard of a manor-house
no occupants of which had been of known
relationship to the Austens, I doubt if it would
have been attributed to her by any one who had
not made a meticulous comparison of its
phraseology with her acknowledged works.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
</p>

<p>
There is, I think, no surer evidence of Jane's
fine taste, alike in character and in literature, than
that, having brought this novel to completion, she
deliberately suppressed it.  Had she sold it to a
publisher, and allowed it to run its chance of
popularity like the rest of her finished novels, we
should have had to revise our views on her nature
and judgment to a considerable extent.  As it is,
the fact that having written a poor novel of
disagreeable tendency she recognized the unsatisfactory
thing that she had done in time to cancel
it is much in her favour, and justifies the opinion
that whatever defects of subject or of treatment
we may find in <i>Lady Susan</i> were condemned by
its author.  It is for this reason that we need not
regret the decision of her nephew and niece to
publish, many years after their aunt's death, the
book which she herself had withheld.  Only, let
us never forget as we read it that it was cancelled
by the author.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Watsons</i> was produced, as far as can be
ascertained, in that middle period of Jane's life
when, after her father's resignation of the Steventon
living he was spending his few remaining years
at Bath with his wife and daughters.  Having
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
written three of her six novels in the nineties of the
eighteenth century&mdash;the six novels by which she
chose to be judged&mdash;at Steventon, she produced
nothing more of her best until at Chawton, in the
early years of the nineteenth century, she
completed her life's work.
</p>

<p>
All her books that live by their own merits
were written in the heart of the country.  The
book that comes nearest to the commonest fiction
of her period was chiefly written in a town which,
however staid and irreproachable in its tone at
the present date, was in her time a centre of
worldliness and frivolity.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Rivals</i> was first acted in the year of Jane
Austen's birth, but the picture it offers of Bath
society is almost as true of 1802 as of 1775.  Dress
had changed much in the intervening years, but in
all else there seems to have been little change
between the Bath of Sheridan the lover of Elizabeth
Linley, and the Bath of Sheridan the friend of the
Prince Regent.  It was among Lydia Languishes
and Captain Absolutes that Jane Austen walked
in Milsom Street and danced at the Assembly-rooms
in 1802-5, and it was in an atmosphere of
social affectation and busy idleness that she found
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
her powers unequal to any nobler performance
than the account of the husband-hunting and silly
young women who angle for Lord Osborne and
his friends.  The futilities of <i>The Watsons</i> form
a remarkable interlude between <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i> and <i>Mansfield Park</i>.
</p>

<p>
The rural society into which Jane Austen takes
us in all her novels marks a rapid development
from the manners of the preceding age.  If we
regard the Squire Western of Fielding as
representative of a considerable class of the country
gentlemen of his time, we may wonder how it is
that no such rude disturber of the peace bursts in
among the Woodhouses and the Dashwoods.  His
nearest relation in Jane's novels is Sir John
Middleton, and he, with all his noise and
ignorance, is a quiet, well-bred person in comparison
with the rude father of the delicious Sophia.
Even the less rubicund and animal squire of the
Hardcastle species is here unknown, and Squire
Allworthy himself would have been strange in the
drawing-rooms of Mansfield Park and Pemberley,
or the parlours of Longbourn and Hartfield.
There is less change to be seen in the "manners
and tone" of the women, especially the younger
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
women, than of the men.  Sophia and Amelia
would have used a few expressions, perhaps, that
might have made Emma stare and cry "Good
God!" or the fine colour deepen on Elizabeth's
cheeks, and Marianne Dashwood would have
confided to Elinor her astonishment that such
otherwise attractive girls should be so ignorant of the
poets, and of the proper arrangement of natural
scenery.  Had the girls become confidential on
further acquaintance, Sophia might have
wondered why Elizabeth said so little about the
appearance of her lover, and so much about his
intelligence.  But Tom Jones and Booth would
never have got on intimate terms with Knightley,
or Darcy, or Edward Ferrars, until these Austen
young men had drunk more port than anybody in
Jane's novels&mdash;with the exception of John Thorpe
as described by himself&mdash;could carry without
disaster.
</p>

<p>
There are no "heroes" among these honest
gentlemen of a hundred years ago.  Wentworth
has indeed won credit and fortune at sea.
Bertram and Knightley do nothing to entitle them to
the name, beyond marrying the heroine.  Edward
Ferrars merely behaves properly in keeping faith
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
with Lucy as long as she wants him.  Darcy is
heroic in taking Mrs. Bennet for a mother-in-law;
Henry Tilney makes fun of his chosen mate in a
way that would have cost him her heart in a more
conventional novel.  "Il y a des héros en mal
comme en bien," says Rochefoucauld, but of the
evil-doing kind there are none here, unless,
indeed, the effrontery with which, after jilting
Marianne for a rich wife, Willoughby comes to her
sister Elinor and asks for her sympathy for his
sad fate, or the coolness of Wickham in the
presence of the people he has wronged may be
regarded as evidence of heroism.
</p>

<p>
It is to the wonderfully true presentation of the
hearts and minds of girls that these novels chiefly
owe their immense power of attraction even for
readers who miss the greater part of the humour.
Fanny Price and Elinor Dashwood are
themselves but poorly endowed with humour, and
Catherine Morland only possesses it in the
rudimentary way of a lively school-girl.  With how
much of understanding, how clearly and fully are
the hopes and fears, the innocent little plans of
Fanny and Catherine, the more mature and
reasoned ways of Elinor shown to us, without the
least apparent effort.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
</p>

<p>
The trustful reader nurtured on the successful
fiction of our own time, especially that of the last
ten years, during which English novelists have
been able to indulge themselves and their public
by the introduction of incidents and types of
character which up to about the commencement of
that decade would have secured the ban of the
circulating libraries, has been led to believe that
sensual impulse plays as large a part in woman's
life as in man's.  That such women as Lady
Bellaston in <i>Tom Jones</i>, Arabelle in <i>Le Lys dans
la Vallée</i>, or the Bellona of <i>Richard Feverel</i> exist,
and in great numbers, is certain, but they are not
representative of woman.  Balzac, who was not:
much restrained by any fear of the libraries, knew
that many faithless wives (so very common in
French fiction and drama, whatever they might be
in life) gave themselves to men their love for
whom contained much less of sensuality than of
other instincts.  Esther, the unhappy Jewess of
<i>Splendeurs et Misèes de Courtisanes</i>, loves
Lucien with an affection far more chaste than that
which many a correct heroine is made to display
for the man with whom she goes to the altar in the
last chapter.  The mistresses of famous men, as
known to us from memoirs and histories, have not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
generally been of a sensual nature.  Aspasia, most
distinguished of them all, was of the intellectual,
not the sensual, type.  Strangely indelicate as
was Madame du Châtelet, her relations with
Voltaire were based on affinity of literary taste and
critical appreciation much more than on physical
attraction.  Even among the unintellectual women
who have figured among the <i>grandes amoureuses</i>
of history, the passion of the woman does not in
most instances appear to have been of the coarser
kind.  Louise de la Vallière is at least more
typical of womanhood than Barbara Villiers.
</p>

<p>
Emma Woodhouse, deeply distressed at the
supposed intention of Knightley to marry Harriet
Smith, feels that she cares not what may happen,
if he will but remain single all his life.  "Could
she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying
at all, she believed she should be perfectly
satisfied.  Let him but continue the same
Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same
Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and
Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of
friendship and confidence, and her peace would
be fully secured.  Marriage, in fact, would not do
for her."  Marriage, we know, "did for her" very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
well, and not at all, so far as we have her story,
in the idiomatic sense in which the words are
commonly used.  But in this healthy maiden, who
could regard with equanimity a future wherein
the man she liked best should never be more to
her than a dear friend who dropped in for tea or
supper, we have an effective illustration of the
relative insignificance of passion in Jane Austen's
view of life.
</p>

<p>
Emma Woodhouse has near relations in Elinor
Dashwood and Edward Ferrars, who, after the
marriage of Lucy Steele to Robert Ferrars had
cleared away the only barrier to their own avowals
of affection, "were neither of them quite enough
in love to think that three hundred and fifty
pounds a year would supply them with the
comforts of life."  Kitty and Lydia Bennet could
simultaneously adore all the officers of a militia
regiment, but there was nothing of the "all for
love, and the world well lost" nonsense about
any of the agreeable women of Jane Austen's
creation.  They were not to be captured by a
man's attractions of mind and person in the way
that Millamant was by Mirabell's, nor even by
the art of others, as Beatrice was won for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
Benedick&mdash;and he for her.  The names of Millamant
and Beatrice were in the ancestral tree of
Elizabeth Bennet, but her pulses beat more regularly
than theirs.
</p>

<p>
In the effect of Mary Crawford's charms on
Edmund Bertram we may see some pale
suggestion of such an awakening as that of Robert
Orange (in <i>The School for Saints</i>), who, on
meeting with Brigit, "suddenly had found presented to
him a mind and a nature in such complete
harmony with his own that it had seemed as though he
were the words and she the music, of one song."  But
it was only a "seeming" in Edmund's case,
and while we read Jane Austen our thoughts are
rarely allowed to flow into a "Romeo and Juliet"
channel for more than a few moments at a time.
</p>

<p>
The re-awakening of Wentworth's dormant love
for Anne Elliot would have afforded to most lady
novelists an opportunity for some fine, romantic
writing.  Jane Austen allows herself no romance
in the matter.  The sea air at Lyme has heightened
Anne's colour, and a passing visitor&mdash;her
cousin, as it happens&mdash;is attracted by her appearance.
Wentworth notices his glances of admiration
and is <i>reminded</i> that she is charming!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
"When they came to the steps leading upwards
from the beach, a gentleman, at the same moment
preparing to come down, politely drew back and
stopped to give them way.  They ascended and
passed him; and as they passed, Anne's face
caught his eye, and he looked at her with a degree
of earnest admiration which she could not be
insensible of.  She was looking remarkably well;
her very regular, very pretty features having the
bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine
wind which had been blowing on her complexion,
and by the animation of eye which it had also
produced.  It was evident that the gentleman
(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her
exceedingly.  Captain Wentworth looked round
at her instantly in a way which showed his noticing
of it.  He gave her a momentary glance&mdash;a glance
of brightness which seemed to say, 'That man is
struck with you'&mdash;and even I, at this moment, see
something like Anne Elliot again."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This scene may be deficient in the sentiment that
delights Catherine Morlands and Marianne
Dashwoods, but it is a bit of true observation of a
familiar phase of human folly.  Archbishop
Whately remarks that: "Authoresses ... can scarcely
ever forget that they <i>are authoresses</i>.  They seem
to feel a sympathetic shudder at exposing naked
a female mind.  <i>Elles se peignent en buste</i>, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
leave the mysteries of womanhood to be described
by some interloping male, like Richardson or
Marivaux, who is turned out before he has seen
half the rites, and is forced to spin from his own
conjectures the rest.  Now from this fault Miss
Austin is free.  Her heroines are what one knows
women must be, though one never can get them
to acknowledge it."  It is a striking proof of
the little that was known of Jane Austen by
her contemporaries that, even four years after her
death, neither Whately himself, nor the editor of
the <i>Quarterly Review</i> knew how to spell her name.
</p>

<p>
The criticism that the mind brought up on
modern fiction would be likely to make on the
girls of Jane Austen would be the reverse of
Whately's.  It would be that her chief defect
in depicting woman's character was that she
almost invariably did force the reader to spin from
his own conjectures when the "mysteries of the
heart" were the subject of her pages.  The truth
is divided, I think, between the Archbishop and
the supposed modern critic.  Jane's heroines are
true women, admirably portrayed, but they only
represent a certain proportion of their sex.  It
could never be suspected of Elizabeth, or Elinor,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
or Anne, or Fanny that there was Southern blood
in her veins.  There might have been a few drops&mdash;no
more&mdash;in Marianne's.  The feelings of the
author are reflected in her most attractive
characters.  She might have married, again and
again, of that there can be small doubt; and while
for herself she shared Dorothy Osborne's opinion
as to the essentials of conjugal happiness, I fancy
that she would also have agreed with Dorothy's
brother that "all passions have more of trouble
than satisfaction in them, and therefore they are
happiest that have least of them."  That, indeed,
as we have already seen, was very much the fault
that Miss Brontë found in her as a novelist.
</p>

<p>
Anne Elliot comes nearer than any of her
fellow-heroines to Dorothy Osborne's ideal of the
changelessness of affection, the true union of
hearts, but, save for her involuntary tears at the
Musgroves', she kept her feelings under the most
perfect control, and never, we may be sure, tried
to beat her convictions into the heads of her silly
family, or even of her faithful friend Lady
Russell.
</p>

<p>
There were, we may fairly believe, not a few
who would like to have been Jane's chosen mate.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
One such unhappy being seems, as we read, to
be the actor in the little bit of serious comedy
related, with lively exaggeration, in a letter written
when she was twenty-five years old.  "Your
unfortunate sister was betrayed last Thursday into
a situation of the utmost cruelty.  I arrived at
Ashe Park before the party from Deane, and was
shut up in the drawing-room with Mr. Holder
alone for ten minutes.  I had some thoughts of
insisting on the housekeeper or Mary Corbett
being sent for, and nothing could prevail on me
to move two steps from the door, on the lock of
which I kept one hand constantly fixed."
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Bennet was not more uncomfortable
when her mother took Kitty up-stairs after
breakfast in order that Mr. Collins might have what
he called "The honour of a private audience"
with the elder girl.  "Dear ma'am," Elizabeth
cried, "do not go.  I beg you will not go.
Mr. Collins must excuse me.  He can have nothing
to say to me that anybody need not hear.  I am
going away myself."  But her mother's, "Lizzy,
I <i>insist</i> upon your staying and hearing
Mr. Collins," compelled her to remain, with results
for which we must ever be grateful to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
Mrs. Bennet.  It is not clear, however, that
Mr. Holder was a suitor for Jane.  We are left in
doubt both as to his hopes and his demerits.
</p>

<p>
There is a little matter connected with the
<i>Quarterly's</i> two articles in praise of Jane which is
perhaps worth noting here.  Gifford, who was
editor when both appeared, was so warm a
supporter of the Prince Regent that Hazlitt&mdash;one
of Gifford's "beasts"&mdash;wrote in an open letter to
him: "When you damn an author, one knows
that he is not a favourite at Carlton House."  Now
the Prince is said to have been so fond of
Jane Austen's novels that he kept a set in each
of his residences, and it is unquestionable that,
in consequence of a suggestion that was "equivalent
to a command," she dedicated Emma to him.
"You will be pleased to hear," she wrote on
April 1, 1816, to John Murray the First, who
published the book, "that I have received the
Prince's thanks for the <i>handsome</i> copy I sent him
of 'Emma.'  Whatever he may think of <i>my</i> share
of the work, yours seems to have been quite right."
</p>

<p>
In the same letter she expresses her disappointment
at the "total omission of 'Mansfield Park'"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
in the <i>Quarterly's</i> review of her work in the
preceding autumn.  As to that review, it is a curious
fact that until Lockhart's "Life of Scott"
appeared, Whately, who wrote the 1821 article,
was credited with the authorship of the earlier
review, and it is still to be found against his name
in the British Museum catalogue, not from the
ignorance of the cataloguers, but because he
appears as author on the title-page of a reprint
of the article issued at Ahmedabad in 1889.

THE IMPARTIAL SATIRIST
</h3>

<p class="intro">
What has woman done?&mdash;"Nature's Salic law"&mdash;Women
deficient in satire&mdash;Some types in the novels&mdash;The
female snob&mdash;The valetudinarian&mdash;The fop&mdash;The too
agreeable man&mdash;"Personal size and mental

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is a commonplace of those who refuse to
recognize the claims of woman to equal treatment
in spheres of activity where man has long held a
monopoly, to ask what great thing has woman
done in any walk of life?  One may talk in reply
of Sappho, of Joan of Arc, of George Sand, of
George Eliot, of Florence Nightingale, and two
or three others, and the retort, if the greatness of
these be admitted, is that they are the exceptions
that "prove" the rule.  It is difficult, impossible
perhaps, to upset the man who denies that anything
of "the greatest" in art, or literature, or
science has been achieved by a woman.  The list
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
of women who have left an abiding fame as poets,
or novelists, or painters is soon exhausted, and
there is not a name that can, without reserve, be
placed among the Rembrandts and Turners, the
Goethes and Miltons, the Newtons and Darwins
of mankind.  Maybe this deficiency is largely due
to lack of opportunity.  Since the gates were
partly opened to woman, within the lifetime of
those who are still not old, she has done enough
to change the opinions of many who held that
rocking the cradle was a sufficiently active share
in the ruling of the world for the sex that
produced the Maid of Orleans and the Lady with
the Lamp.  Such justly conspicuous success as
Madame Curie has attained in chemistry, or
Mrs. Garrett Anderson in medicine, or Mrs. Scharlieb
in surgery, has compelled the admission that even
if woman were by nature unfitted to reach the
highest levels of intellectual achievement, she at
least could not be excluded from the learned
professions on the ground of inadequate mental
equipment.
</p>

<p>
"Nature's old Salic law," said Huxley, "will
not be repealed, and no change of dynasty will
be effected."  Jane Austen, at any rate, did not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
desire to repeal it.  She was among the most
feminine of the women writers who have left an
enduring reputation.  It is something of a paradox,
therefore, that the quality on which her fame
chiefly rests is one which is rare among women,
and in which most of those women who have
attained success in literature have been
conspicuously lacking&mdash;satirical humour.  Apart
from physical disabilities, want of humour is
woman's heaviest handicap in the conflict of
life.  Humour is the principal ingredient of the
philosophic temperament.  Woman has courage
in adversity, she can suffer intensely without
complaint, but she rarely possesses the power of
laughing at her own misfortunes.
</p>

<p>
It has been said, and the saying might not
easily be gainsaid, that none of the great jokes of
the world was made by a woman.  There are
perhaps fifty great jokes&mdash;spoken jokes, of course,
are meant, not those generally humourless things
known as "practical jokes"&mdash;and the good stories
that are told and received as novelties are, save
in the rarest instances, merely new editions of
some wheeze which was already ancient when it
was told to a circle of mead-drinkers round a fire
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
the smoke whereof&mdash;or some of it&mdash;escaped
through the roof.  It is, there is reason to believe,
no mere figure of speech that originally most of
the basic jokes were told round the galley fire of
the Ark during the long dark evenings after the
animals had been fed, the decks swept down, and
the women had retired to their quarters.  Thus
may we account for the otherwise inexplicably
large proportion of sea-faring and animal tales
among the mirth-provoking yarns of man.  A
woman might never make a joke, and yet have a
keen sense of humour, while, on the other hand,
she might make many jokes, and have no sense
of humour at all.  Most of the jokes that have any
element of freshness are alive with fun, and not
with humour.  Who is more humourless than the
notoriously funny man?
</p>

<p>
Jane Austen is not often funny and seldom
makes jokes in her novels.  Her humour is of the
essential kind, which is so nearly akin to wit that
it is often almost identical with it.  Wit and
humour, after all definitions, are brothers who
might be taken for one another by those who do
not notice that the one has colder hands than the
other.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
</p>

<p>
If you want to laugh heartily you must not
trust to Jane's novels for a stimulant.  Her
characters laugh but little among themselves, and
are the cause of intellectual joy rather than of
physical contractions in those who read about
them.
</p>

<p>
When, after a re-reading of the novels, we sit
and think over their delights, many are the
admirable bits of character-drawing that come to mind.
After we have thought of the heroines, the "good"
people, in the common meaning of the word, do
not come back to us so readily as those who, if
not "bad," are decidedly faulty.  The Westons,
the Gardiners, the Harvilles, the Crofts, Lady
Russell, the John Knightleys, we recall when we
jog our memories.  After Elizabeth, and Emma,
and Anne, it is the appallingly tactless
Mrs. Bennet, the odiously snobbish Mrs. Elton, the
race-proud Lady Catherine, the entirely selfish
Mr. Collins, the lazy and thoughtless Lady
Bertram, the mean and tyrannical Mrs. Norris, the
fatuous Sir Walter Elliot, these and their like,
who throng into view.  No writer&mdash;not even
Thackeray&mdash;has realized the female snob more
knowingly than Jane Austen in Mrs. Elton, whose
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
constant reference of all matters of taste to the
standard presented by "Maple Grove" and the
"barouche-landau" renders her as diverting to
us as she was insufferable to Emma Woodhouse.
A woman like this, who is never betrayed into an
unselfish action or a noble aspiration, is happily
not a common object in real life, but there are
enough of Mrs. Elton's great-granddaughters
about the world to exculpate Jane from the charge
of undue exaggeration.  Emma herself has been
called a snob, and only the other day was
described as "perpetually acting with bad taste."  But
Emma's disdain for Robert Martin, and her
opinion of the degradation of marrying a governess,
were due to prejudices of convention, which
thought&mdash;under Knightley's influence&mdash;dispelled.
Mrs. Elton was a snob at heart, who revelled in
her own vulgarity of instinct.
</p>

<p>
If the snob is portrayed to perfection in
Mrs. Elton, the valetudinarian is no less happily
presented in Mr. Woodhouse&mdash;"My dear Emma,
suppose we all have a little gruel"&mdash;and for a
picture of an empty-headed, frivolous wife married
to a rational and bearish husband, the Palmers,
in <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, have few equals.  As for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
Miss Bates, she is without a serious rival as an
inconsequential babbler, and though we may be,
and ought to be, as angry with Emma for her
rudeness at the Box Hill picnic as was
Mr. Knightley himself, we must admit that years of
Miss Bates's disjoined garrulity were some set-off
against that gross breach of charity and good
manners.  Lady Catherine de Bourgh has been
placed by some critical readers among Jane
Austen's obvious caricatures.  Is she not an
entirely credible, if happily rare, type?  She is seen
in a strong light in her attempt to bully Elizabeth
into a promise not to marry Darcy&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"'With regard to the resentment of his family,'
says Elizabeth at last, 'or the indignation of the
world, if the former <i>were</i> excited by his marrying
me, it would not give me one moment's concern&mdash;and
the world in general would have too much
sense to join in the scorn.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'And this is your real opinion!' replies Lady
Catherine.  'This is your final resolve!  Very
well.  I shall now know how to act.  Do not
imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will
ever be gratified.  I came to try you.  I hoped
to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I
will carry my point.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning
hastily round, she added&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.  I
send no compliments to your mother.  You
deserve no such attention.  I am most seriously
displeased.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Elizabeth made no answer, and without
attempting to persuade her ladyship to return
into the house, walked quietly into it herself."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Thus ends one of the great scenes of Jane
Austen, a bit of duologue which gives us the
natures and capacities of two remarkable people,
a charming, clear-headed, self-reliant girl, and a
blustering, stupidly proud old woman.
</p>

<p>
Sir Walter Elliot is the companion figure, more
highly-coloured, of Lady Catherine.  This man,
a vain fop who has not sense enough to govern
his own affairs, regards professional men as
contemptible, if necessary, adjuncts of society, and,
at a time when only the splendid services of our
sailors had saved England from disaster he thus
babbles about the navy&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me, I have
two strong grounds of objection to it.  First, as
being the means of bringing persons of obscure
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
birth into undue distinction, and raising men to
honours which their fathers and grandfathers
never dreamt of; and, secondly, as it cuts up a
man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor
grows old sooner than any other man.  I have
observed it all my life.  A man is in greater danger
in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one
whose father his father might have disdained to
speak to, and of becoming prematurely an object
of disgust himself, than in any other line.  One
day last spring, in town, I was in company with
two men, striking instances of what I am talking
of,&mdash;Lord St. Ives, whose father we all know to
have been a country curate, without bread to eat: I
was to give place to Lord St. Ives,&mdash;and a certain
Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking
personage you can imagine; his face the colour
of mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree;
all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,
and nothing but a dab of powder at top.  'In the
name of heaven, who is that old fellow?' said I
to a friend of mine who was standing near (Sir
Basil Morley).  'Old fellow!' cried Sir Basil, 'it
is Admiral Baldwin.  What do you take his age
to be?'  'Sixty,' said I, 'or perhaps sixty-two.'  'Forty,'
replied Sir Basil, 'forty, and no more.'  Picture
to yourselves my amazement: I shall not
easily forget Admiral Baldwin.  I never saw quite
so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life
can do; but to a degree, I know it is the same
with them all: they are all knocked about, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
exposed to every climate, and every weather, till
they are not fit to be seen.  It is a pity they are
not knocked on the head at once, before they
reach Admiral Baldwin's age."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There have been such fools as Sir Walter
Elliot, but as a type he is overdrawn.  Jane loved
the navy so much that her anger with those who
disparaged it gave her pen speed and added
colour to the ink.
</p>

<p>
Anne's cousin William Elliot, whose attentions
to her help to revive Wentworth's affection, is
more closely studied by the author than any of
her "heroes."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Everything united in him; good understanding,
correct opinions, knowledge of the world,
and a warm heart.  He had strong feelings of
family attachment and family honour, without
pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality
of a man of fortune, without display; he judged
for himself in everything essential, without
defying public opinion in any point of worldly
decorum.  He was steady, observant, moderate,
candid; never run away with by spirits or by
selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and
yet, with a sensibility to what was amiable and
lovely, and a value for all the felicities of domestic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and
violent agitation seldom really possess."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
Anne, however, was not long in discovering grave
defects in this outwardly model person.  She saw
that while he was
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"rational, discreet, polished, he was not open.
There never was any burst of feeling, any warmth
of indignation or delight, at the evil or good of
others.  This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.
Her early impressions were incurable.  She
prized the frank, the open-hearted, the eager
character beyond all others.  Warmth and enthusiasm
did captivate her still.  She felt that she could so
much more depend upon the sincerity of those
who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty
thing, than of those whose presence of mind never
varied, whose tongue never slipped.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Mr. Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various
as were the tempers in her father's house, he
pleased them all.  He endured too well, stood
too well with everybody."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Those who accuse Jane Austen of hardness
have sometimes relied on her treatment of
Mrs. Musgrove's sorrow over her ne'er-do-well son,
long after his death, to support this charge.  Anne
and Wentworth, whose mutual liking was just
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
beginning to bloom again, were "actually on the
same sofa, for Mrs. Musgrove had most readily
made room for him; they were divided only by
Mrs. Musgrove.  It was no insignificant barrier,
indeed.  Mrs. Musgrove was of a comfortable,
substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature
to express good cheer and good humour than
tenderness and sentiment; and while the
agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face,
may be considered as very completely screened,
Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit
for the self-command with which he attended to
her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,
whom alive nobody had cared for."  And then
the author stops in her narrative to observe that
"Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly
no necessary proportions.  A large, bulky figure
has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the
most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair
or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions,
which reason will patronize in vain&mdash;which taste
cannot tolerate&mdash;which ridicule will seize."
</p>

<p>
She thus bluntly expresses what almost every
satirist merely implies, but she underrates her own
powers.  The ordinary writer might or might not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
be able to describe the grief of "a large, bulky
figure" without offence to the ordinary "taste."  Genius
could assuredly do this thing.  Shakespeare,
with whom Whately, Macaulay and
Tennyson compared Jane Austen, made one of
his greatest characters "fat and scant of breath,"
but when Hamlet says to his friend, "Thou
woulds't not think how ill all's here about my
heart," we do not find it "ridiculous" that this
"too, too solid flesh" should be joined with a
mind weighted with such poignant sorrow.  In
any case, whether she mistrusted her own powers,
or wanted Mrs. Musgrove to be slightly ridiculous,
which seems more likely, Jane did not here strive
to achieve what she pointedly tells us it would
be beyond reason to expect.

The character of Emma is described with
unusual fulness, but the description is placed in
the mouth of George Knightley, her candid
admirer, who was perhaps not guiltless of the
fault which Fainall attributed to Mirabell, of
being "too discerning in the failings of his
mistress."  Mrs. Weston ("Miss Taylor that was")
has said that Emma means to read with Harriet
Smith&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'Emma has been meaning to read more ever
since she was twelve years old,' replies
Mr. Knightley.  'I have seen a great many lists of
her drawing-up, at various times, of books that
she meant to read regularly through&mdash;and very
good lists they were, very well chosen, and very
neatly arranged&mdash;sometimes alphabetically, and
sometimes by some other rule.  The list she drew
up when only fourteen&mdash;I remember thinking it
did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved
it some time, and I dare say she may have made
out a very good list now.  But I have done with
expecting any course of steady reading from
Emma.  She will never submit to anything requiring
industry and patience, and a subjection of the
fancy to the understanding.  Where Miss Taylor
failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet
Smith will do nothing.  You never could persuade
her to read half so much as you wished.  You
know you could not.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'I dare say,' replied Mrs. Weston, smiling,
'that I thought so <i>then</i>; but since we have parted,
I can never remember Emma's omitting to do
anything I wished.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'There is hardly any desiring to refresh such
a memory as <i>that</i>,' said Mr. Knightley, feelingly;
and for a moment or two he had done.  'But I,'
he soon added, 'who have had no such charm
thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and
remember.  Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest
of her family.  At ten years old she had the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
misfortune of being able to answer questions
which puzzled her sister at seventeen.  She was
always quick and assured; Isabella slow and
diffident.  And ever since she was twelve, Emma
has been mistress of the house and of you all.  In
her mother she lost the only person able to cope
with her.'"

<p>
An unhappy condition of most of Jane's
heroines is that they are of necessity ashamed of
their nearest relations.  Anne Elliot felt this
trouble keenly, when at length she and Wentworth
decided to take the happiness which she had
refused years before&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady
Russell's meaning to love Captain Wentworth as
she ought, had no other alloy to the happiness of
her prospects than what arose from the consciousness
of having no relations to bestow on him
which a man of sense could value.  There she
felt her own inferiority keenly.  The disproportion
in their fortune was nothing; it did not give
her a moment's regret; but to have no family to
receive and estimate him properly, nothing of
respectability, of harmony, of good will, to offer
in return for all the worth and all the prompt
welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters,
was a source of as lively pain as her mind could
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
well be sensible of under circumstances of
otherwise strong felicity."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
One can readily understand her regret.  Her
father was a fool, her elder sister Elizabeth a
slave of convention, with few rational ideas of her
own, and her younger sister a neurotic egotist,
who grudged to others the simplest pleasures
if she did not feel able or disposed to share
them.
</p>

<p>
Fanny Price was ashamed of the slovenly
home at Portsmouth to which Henry Crawford so
inopportunely penetrated.  Elizabeth Bennet's
mother was, of course, more nearly "impossible"
even than Lady Catherine had so pointedly
suggested, for her defects were far worse than those
of obscure birth.  This terrible woman, who kept
her elder daughters constantly on the rack by her
fatuous chatter, who always said the wrong thing,
who had no desire for her children's welfare but
to marry them to anybody, with money if possible,
or without it rather than not at all, made one of
her usual quick changes when she heard the
surprising news of Elizabeth's engagement to
Darcy&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
"She began at length to recover, to fidget about
in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and
bless herself.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'Good gracious!  Lord bless me! only think! dear
me!  Mr. Darcy!  Who would have thought
it!  And it is really true?  Oh, my sweetest
Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be!  What
pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have!
Jane's is nothing to it&mdash;nothing at all.  I am so
pleased&mdash;so happy!  Such a charming man!&mdash;so
handsome! so tall&mdash;Oh, my dear Lizzy!  pray
apologize for my having disliked him so much
before.  I hope he will overlook it.  Dear, dear
Lizzy!  A house in town!  Everything that is
charming!  Three daughters married!  Ten
thousand a-year!  Oh, Lord! what will become
of me?  I shall go distracted.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"This was enough to prove that her approbation
need not be doubted; and Elizabeth, rejoicing
that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away.  But before she had been three
minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'My dearest child,' she cried, 'I can think of
nothing else!  Ten thousand a-year, and very
likely more!  'Tis as good as a lord!  And a
special license.  You must and shall be married
by a special license.  But, my dearest love, tell
me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"This was a sad omen of what her mother's
behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of
her relations' consent, there was still something to
be wished for."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Of Catherine Morland we are told that "her
whole family were plain matter-of-fact people, who
seldom aimed at wit of any kind; her father at the
utmost being contented with a pun, and her mother
with a proverb."  Having given us this little
<i>aperçu</i> of Mr. and Mrs. Morland, the author, <i>more
suo</i>, adds the information: "They were not in
the habit, therefore, of telling lies to increase their
importance, or of asserting at one moment what
they would contradict the next."
</p>

<p>
If we seek in our memories for scenes of
particular excellence we shall recall with renewed
pleasure the rehearsals (<i>Mansfield Park</i>), the
encounters between Elizabeth and Mr. Collins
and Elizabeth and Lady Catherine (<i>Pride and
Prejudice</i>), the second and last proposal of
Wentworth to Anne Elliot (<i>Persuasion</i>), the picnic
at Box Hill and the dance at the "Crown"
(<i>Emma</i>).  In all of these the spontaneity of the
narrative, the vitality of the talk and the vividness
with which the circumstances are realized with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
the smallest amount of description show the
author's art in its most delightful vein.
</p>

<p>
It is often in little touches, generally satirical,
that Jane Austen reveals the characters of her
people.  Lady Middleton, whose "reserve was a
mere calmness of <i>manner</i> with which <i>sense</i> had
nothing to do"; Mary Bennet, whom, when her
sisters visited her, "they found, as usual, deep in
the study of thorough bass and human nature,
and had some new extracts to admire, and some
new observations of threadbare morality to listen
to"; the gushing Louisa Musgrove, who declared
that if she loved a man as Mrs. Croft loved the
Admiral, she "would always be with him, nothing
should ever separate" them, and that she "would
rather be overturned by him, than driven safely
by anybody else"; Mr. Allen, a country
gentleman of fortune who "did not care about the
garden, and never went into it"; and General
Tilney, poring over pamphlets when he ought to
be in bed, blinding his eyes "for the good of
others" who would never benefit in the least by
his exertions; the heartless and humbugging
Mrs. Norris, whose plentiful talk about helping
her poor, child-burdened sister ended in her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
"writing the letters" while others sent substantial
assistance&mdash;these, and many other entertaining
people live for us largely from such casual peeps
into their natures and sentiments.
</p>

<p>
Jane Austen rarely describes a man or woman
as possessing qualities which are not justified by
the evidence she offers.  Almost the only notable
exceptions are Mrs. Dashwood, of whom we are
told that "a man could not very well be in love
with either of her daughters, without extending
the passion to her," but who does not herself give
us any reason to regard her as other than an
affectionate, well-meaning, and injudicious person,
and Captain Wentworth, who is stated to have
been witty, but who usually manages to restrain
his wit when we happen to meet him.
</p>

<p>
The many parsons of the novels are at once
too steady and too prosperous to be in accord with
either of the types of eighteenth-century clergy
most frequently conveyed by the literature of
their period.  They may not have done much for
their parishioners beyond preaching to them once
or twice a week, and sending them soup occasionally,
but they set them good examples by conducting
themselves decently and soberly.  Of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
their "views" we know little.  Indeed, few
things are more remarkable in these novels, in
the light of later fiction, than that almost complete
absence of any reference to dogmatic religion to
which attention has already been drawn.  You
may hunt through them all and hardly find two
definite statements that, except to see what the
vicar's bride was like, any of the characters went
to church.  We know that the parsons preached,
but whether there was any one to hear their
sermons we are usually left in doubt.  In fact,
as Dr. Whately puts it, the author's religion is
"not at all obtrusive."  His favourable view of
Jane Austen's influence may be contrasted with
Robert Hall's of Maria Edgeworth's: "In point
of tendency I should class her books among the
most irreligious I ever read....  She does not
attack religion nor inveigh against it, but makes
it appear unnecessary by exhibiting perfect virtue
without it."
</p>

<p>
It has frequently been said that the atmosphere
of Jane Austen's books is "Church of England,"
and this is in a sense true.  She assumes that
the squires of whom she writes are adherents of
Church and State, much as a provincial
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
clergyman wrote quite recently in his Parish Magazine:
"It is generally taken for granted that Church is
the only possible religion for an English
gentleman."  We meet with no Romish priests or
Methodist preachers, not so much as a member
of the Society of Friends, but, on the other hand,
we meet with no one who talks against faith.  It
was a period when the Church itself had become
apathetic, when pluralists abounded, and when
many rectors lived comfortably on their great
tithes, far from the parishes which they left to
the care of curates who were often worse off than
gamekeepers.  A young man went into the
Church, if there was a good living to be had, just
as he went to the Bar if his uncle was a flourishing
attorney, or into the navy if his friends had
influence with the Board of Admiralty.  Many
parsons, if they were well-to-do and fond of
society, did not even wear any distinctive dress.
One meets vicars and curates to-day, in
summer-time, wearing green ties and grey tweed suits,
and even a bishop has been known to abandon
his episcopal uniform when he was away on a
holiday.  But, to take an instance from the
novels, Catherine Morland, who has met Henry
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
Tilney at a dance in Bath, and meets him again
at the Pump-room or elsewhere, does not know
he is a clergyman until she is told.  The Church
was merely a profession for most of those who
entered it.  "Did Henry's income depend solely
on his living," says General Tilney, "he would
not be well provided for.  Perhaps it may seem
odd, that with only two younger children, I should
think any profession necessary to him; and
certainly there are moments when we could all wish
him disengaged from every tie of business."  The
most conscientious clergyman in the Austen
Comedy is Edmund Bertram, who really seems
to have wished to do his duty, and thereby
damaged his chance of marrying Mary Crawford.
</p>

<p>
The scanty reference to the observances of
religion in the novels bears on the worldly life of
the age, as we know it from those who were of
it and saw it at its centre of activity, London
society.  Doctor Warner, George Selwyn's
chaplain, who attracted large congregations by his
eloquent preaching, and who was an avowed
sceptic away from church, who toadied the rich
and noble, and told stories that delighted the
Duke of Queensberry, was no rare type of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
clergy of his time, and we may be pretty certain
that Jane Austen's Mr. Collins (who was not at
all likely to tell an improper story himself) would
have found it very difficult to believe that so
exalted a personage as "Old Q." was unfit for
the society of clergymen.
</p>

<p>
Jane frankly admitted that she knew too little
of literature, philosophy, and science, to allow
her adequately to draw the character of a scholarly
and serious parson.  "The comic side of the
character I might be equal to, but not the good,
the enthusiastic, the literary.  Such a man's
conversation must at times be on subjects of science
and philosophy of which I know nothing, or at
least occasionally abundant in quotations and
allusions which a woman who, like me, knows
only her own mother tongue, and has read little
in that, would be totally without the power of
giving."  According to her brother and her
nephew, Jane was better educated than she here
makes out, knowing French, and a good deal of
Italian.  Whether we believe her or not about
her literary and linguistic limitations, we can have
small doubt that she knew very little indeed about
science and philosophy, in spite of being so much
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
of a philosopher.  In those days, when Cuvier
was bringing his genius in palæontology to bear
on the recovery of lost types, and preparing a
way for Darwin, whose own grandfather was
bravely aiding in the clearance of paths in
hitherto trackless jungles of prejudice and
obscurantism, science was scarcely regarded as a decent
subject of conversation before ladies in country
drawing-rooms, and it never obtrudes itself at
Hartfield or at Mansfield Park.
</p>

<p>
If we may read through every word of Jane's
novels without discovering any expression of
dogmatic belief, we may equally find no direct
evidence, unless in that one story of Elinor and
Willoughby, of acceptance of the chilly Deism
which had eaten so deeply into the intellects both
of laymen and clergy.  The unrest, both moral
and physical, which had spread from Paris, from
Holland, and from Switzerland over the whole
of Western Europe at that time, finds little
place for its fidgeting in the families to whom we
are here introduced.  People, with the rare
exceptions of a Wickham or a Willoughby, are born,
live, and die, in peace with the world and in
general harmony with their environments.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
</p>

<p>
Admirable as Jane Austen's pictures of country
life in house and garden are, they are not to be
accepted as literal transcripts.  She was, before
all else, an artist, and the more an artist is devoted
to finicking reproduction of exact details the
further is he removed from art.  Almost every
author, if he writes with sincerity, must draw his
own moral portrait in his best work.  In a literal
sense there is no reason to suppose that novelists
often give us studies of themselves in any degree
comparable with the self-portraits of Rembrandt,
Velasquez, Madame Vigée le Brun or the moderns
in the Uffizi Gallery.  Sometimes, of course, as in
<i>Villette</i> and <i>Delphine</i>, an author reports episodes
in his life almost as they happened, and it is
certain, save in the rarest cases, that something
of an author's mental processes is reproduced in
all his creatures, "bad" as well as "good,"
though he is more likely to show his own temperament
and experience in a prominent and sympathetic
character than in any other.  Very few
writers follow the example of Milton, of whom
Coleridge declared "his Satan, his Adam, his
Raphael, almost all his Eve, are all John Milton."  The
common mistake, a mistake so obvious that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
we may wonder at its continuance, is such a close
identification of the author with any one of his
creations.  Thus, because "Vivian Grey is
Disraeli himself," Disraeli is to be credited with
the strange experiences of that uneasy hero
among foreign politicians and card-sharpers; and
because "Jane Eyre is Charlotte Brontë,"
Charlotte Brontë must at least have wished to unite
herself with a wild man whose wife had gone
mad.  There were no doubt readers of Goethe's
<i>Faust</i> who, ignoring the legend, thought the
author had bargained with Mephisto and, it "goes
without saying" (Marianne Dashwood is not
within hearing), that "Hamlet is Shakespeare."  Such
arbitrary reasoning may account for the general
confusion of Frankenstein with the creature that
he made.
</p>

<p>
Among the widest traps, indeed, for those who
love to see a <i>roman à clef</i> in every novel, is this
identification of the author with one or other of
his characters.  Some people have convinced
themselves that Cassandra and Jane Austen were
the originals of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood.
Such an idea could only be held by those who
had not seen Jane's letters.  Marianne,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
sentimental, romantic, disagreeable in a quite serious
way, and usually inattentive "to the forms of
general civility," could not be Jane, and as
certainly not Cassandra as we know her, and while
Elinor, the patient, long-suffering girl, might in
some ways represent either of the Austen sisters,
she is very far from being a portrait.
</p>

<p>
Yet if neither Elinor Dashwood nor Marianne
is to be described as a likeness of Jane, the elder
sister in her philosophical submission to what she
believed to be the loss of her lover, and the
younger in her literary tastes and her impatience
with people who talk without thinking may fairly
be regarded as in part reflecting the author's
personality.  None of her heroines <i>is</i> Jane, but
there is much of her also in Elizabeth Bennet
and Emma Woodhouse, and a good deal in Anne
Elliot, though she admitted that Anne was too
nearly perfect to be altogether after her heart.
The simple little souls of Fanny Price and
Catherine Morland, so dependent on the direct
assistance of others in the formation of their
feelings, are in very small degree expressions of the
author's temperament.  We may, I think, regard
Emma Woodhouse as the nearest approach to a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
portrait of the artist who painted her, but
"nearest" is a relative superlative.  Many people
do not care for Emma.  A strong expression of
recent disapproval was quoted a few pages back.
Jane Austen anticipated objections.  "I am
going," she said, when she was beginning the
book, "to take a heroine whom no one but myself
will much like."
</p>

<p>
Whether or not we may see in Emma a good
deal of Jane herself, we may fairly be certain that
none of her characters is an intentional copy of
any one in the circle of her friends and
acquaintances.  She herself declared her opinion, which
tallies with all that we know of her, that the
introduction of living people as actors in a work
of imagination is a breach of good manners, and
that, propriety apart, she was too proud of her
characters to admit that they were "only Mrs. A. or
Colonel B."  How far she made use of individuals
in the composition of such strongly-marked
figures as Mrs. Elton, Mr. Collins and
Sir Walter Elliot, we cannot, of course, know.
The point, for what it is worth, could have been
better elucidated if Miss Austen's circle had been
less far removed from the world wherein the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
Wraxalls, the Gronows and the Grevilles listen
and watch.  We know that, whatever the degree
of similitude, Disraeli's Rigby offers a recognizable
likeness to Croker, Dickens's Boythorn to
Landor, Stevenson's Weir of Hermiston to
Braxfield.  Accepting Jane Austen's denial of the
deliberate introduction of real persons in her
novels, we cannot tell how many of her Hampshire
acquaintances served intellectually for her
pictures of country society as the maidens of
Crotona served physically for the picture of
Helen by Zeuxis.  We may be certain that, all
unconsciously, they gave her of their best, each
according to his means.

<p class="intro">

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On an earlier page a contrast between Balzac and
Jane Austen has been suggested.  One characteristic
they had in common was the sense of the
reality of their own creations.  Madame de Surville,
the sister of Balzac, has recorded how, when
the affairs of the family were being discussed, he
would say, "Ah, yes, but do you know to whom
Felix de Vandenesse is engaged?  One of the
Grandville girls.  It is an excellent marriage for
him."  Further than this an author's sense of the
actuality of his own imaginings could hardly go,
unless, indeed, like one modern author&mdash;if the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
story is true, as it probably is not&mdash;he were to
invite the figments of his brain to lunch!
</p>

<p>
Jane Austen was not quite so much obsessed by
her inventions, though she spoke of the very
novels themselves as personal entities.  <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i> was "my own darling child," and of
<i>Sense and Sensibility</i> she writes, when it is
passing through the press: "No, indeed, I am never
too busy to think of <i>S. and S</i>.  I can no more
forget it than a mother can forget her sucking
child; and I am much obliged to you for your
inquiries."  As for the characters, she loved to
talk of them as living people, and was so fond of
Elizabeth Bennet, for instance, that, as she wrote
to Cassandra, she did not know how she should be
"able to tolerate" those who did not like her.
</p>

<p>
She used to tell her nieces what happened to her
imaginary people after the novels were ended,
how Mary Bennet married her uncle's clerk, or her
sister Kitty a clergyman, and how Mrs. Robert
Ferrars's sister "never caught the doctor."  One
of the most delightful of her letters, as evidence
of her happiness in her work, and of her half-serious
consciousness of the reality of her creations,
was written after a round of London picture
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
galleries.  The portraits she looked for were not
those of Knights, or Austens, or Leighs, but of
beautiful women out of her own novels.  They
might be labelled Lady this or Mrs. that, but she
should recognize them if they were portraits of
her darling Elizabeth or her dearest Anne.  She
was disappointed.  It is true that at the Gallery
in Spring Gardens she found "a small portrait of
Mrs. Bingley, excessively like her," and,
moreover, "she is dressed in a white gown, with green
ornaments, which convinces me of what I had
always supposed, that green was a favourite colour
with her.  I dare say Mrs. D. will be in
yellow."  For it was "Mrs. D."&mdash;the beloved Elizabeth
Darcy (<i>née</i> Bennet), whose face her creator and
devoted admirer looked forward to seeing on some
fashionable portrait-painter's canvas.  Alas! at
none of the shows was the desired picture to be
found.  "I can only imagine," writes the
disappointed "friend," soothing her regrets with a
reflection natural to her mind, "that Mr. D. prizes
any picture of her too much to like it should be
exposed to the public eye.  I can imagine he
would have that sort of feeling&mdash;that mixture of
love, pride, and delicacy."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
</p>

<p>
Thus we can see that Jane knew exactly what
her heroines were like, even if in their case, as in
that of nearly all her characters, the reader is left
to fill in details of colour and feature very much
as he chooses.  She was far more particular in
describing the personal appearance of real people,
and in her letters the handsome and the ugly are
as clearly differentiated as the lively and the dull.
"I never saw so plain a family"&mdash;she declares
after calling on some people named Fagg&mdash;"five
sisters so very plain!  They are as plain as the
Foresters, or the Franfraddops, or the Seagraves,
or the Rivers, excluding Sophy.  Miss Sally Fagg
has a pretty figure, and that comprises all the good
looks of the family."  Sometimes she attributed
the blame for ill-looks to a definite part of the
genealogical tree.  "I wish she was not so very
Palmery," she says of one of her nieces, "but it
seems stronger than ever, I never knew a wife's
family features have such undue influence."  The
Mrs. Palmer of <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was not
of that family.  She was as pretty as she was
foolish.
</p>

<p>
Even if it be true that Jane Austen only painted
the life which she found immediately around her,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
and that she would almost as soon have attempted
to depict the interior of a Thibetan lamassary as
of an English country-house of the kind Disraeli
loved to paint, yet do her characters "typify
nothing?"  If Mrs. Elton, and Sir John Middleton,
and Mary Musgrove are not types, then I do
not see why Sir Charles Grandison, or
Mrs. Proudie, or Mr. Tulliver should be regarded as
types.  Perhaps they should not, but then, what
are types?  Most of Jane Austen's people may be
common; there may be, in the flesh, a hundred
Lady Russells for one Lady Camper, and five
hundred John Willoughbys for one Willoughby
Patterne.  That is only to say that humanity is
richer in one type than in another.
</p>

<p>
Jane was a realist, though Realism, in the sense
in which we apply the term in the criticism of
living writers, has little place in her novels.  She
assumes that her readers&mdash;the men and women of
her own age&mdash;are neither blind nor unaccustomed
to the ordinary resources of contemporary civilization.
When her characters dine, they may usually,
for all we hear to the contrary, eat out of a common
dish with the aid of their unassisted fingers, after
the manner of the nomads of the Asiatic Steppes;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
they may drink out of gourds like the Bushmen,
while, after the custom of the Romans, they recline
on raised couches in the attitude of Madame
Récamier.  We know that they sat round solid
mahogany or oaken tables, covered with damask
cloths during the meat and pudding service, that
the silver was polished, and the glass bright, even
though the supply of plates was perhaps not
always equal to the number of courses; we have
little doubt as to the kind of chairs whereon the
diners sat, and we may wish we had more of them
in our own dining-rooms.
</p>

<p>
As to the costumes of the men and women who
sat on the chairs, we are usually left to dress them
as we like, and there is little doubt that many a
modern reader has mentally pictured Darcy wearing
a tweed suit and a bowler hat, Charles Musgrove
in a golfing-cap and loose knickerbockers,
and Mr. Collins or Mr. Elton in a stiff
"round-about" collar of the kind usually worn by the
Anglican clergy of to-day.  For the ladies, the
whirligig of time has brought back the modes of
a century ago.  In spite of the cry for the equality
of the sexes, there are, as the Lord Chancellor and
other eminent authorities have laid down, marked
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
distinctions between the ways of women and of
men.  One of such distinctions may be found in
the fact that the fashions of feminine dress move
in a (very irregular and therefore theoretically
impossible) circle, while those of masculine dress
rarely cross the same point twice.  Thus while,
during the last few years, we have seen our sisters
and aunts affecting "modes" that were in vogue
in the periods of the Renaissance, the Directory,
and the Empire, we have never seen our brothers
and uncles abroad in the streets attired like the
courtiers either of François <i>premier</i> or of the First
Consul.  A woman need not despair of wearing,
without being followed by a crowd, almost any
costume of any period of woman's history.  A man
need not look for the day when he may walk in the
parks in the garb of Raleigh or of Burke without
attracting more attention than will be agreeable
to the modesty of any one but an actor-manager
or the European agent of some American
world-industry.  The Misses Bertram, of Mansfield
Park, might go shopping in Regent Street to-day
without any one remarking that their dress, or their
coiffure, was seriously out of date.  But we only
know how they dressed because we know the date
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
of their birth, not because the author of a bit of
their life-history has told us.
</p>

<p>
Who that has ever read <i>Weir of Hermiston</i> can
forget the description of the heroine as she first
appeared to Archie in the kirk?  It was in the
very year (1814) in which Fanny Price's story was
related, and of Mary Crawford, if not of Fanny,
a tale of town finery as bright as that of Kirstie
might have been told.  We know how alluring
Kirstie looked to Archie in her "frock of
straw-coloured jaconet muslin, cut low at the bosom
and short at the ankle," and "drawn up so as to
mould the contour of both breasts, and in the
nook between ... surely in a very enviable
position, trembled the nosegay of primroses."  Of
some such charming pictures we get at least the
preliminary sketches in Jane Austen's letters, but
the finished works are never shown in the novels,
and we may dress the pretty heroines to our own
fancy so long as we keep to the style of their
period, or, if our imaginations are feeble and our
knowledge of Regency costume deficient, Mr. Brock
will do the work for us in the more delightful
of his coloured drawings, or Mr. Hugh Thomson
in his lively illustrations in pen and ink.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
</p>

<p>
This point&mdash;that the material factors of manners
and habits are little noted by Jane Austen&mdash;will
strike many readers, at first sight, as of quite
trivial importance.  But it is largely the reason
why her novels have so modern an external air
compared with those, let us say, of Scott, or even
of Balzac, who only began to write when her short
career was ending.  If Jane Austen had described
the conditions of life at Hartfield or Kellynch
with the particularity with which Balzac describes
the Grandets' house at Saumur, and the Guenics'
at Guerande, or had given us such full accounts
of the villagers on the estate of the Bertrams of
Mansfield Park as Scott gave us of the smugglers
and gipsies on the lands of the Bertrams of
Ellangowan, we should see more clearly the
changes that a hundred years have wrought in
the habits of the English country.
</p>

<p>
Jane Austen was by no means indifferent to the
cut and colour of her own clothing, however little
she allowed her heroines to talk about theirs.  But
when we read of "Jane Austen frocks" for bridesmaids
in the accounts of modern weddings, they
are copied from the illustrations of Mr. Thomson
or Mr. Brock, or else are so-called merely because
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
they are of the period of her novels, which is much
the same thing.  With the general subject of dress
she deals as a novelist, we may almost say once
for all, in a single paragraph of <i>Northanger
Abbey</i>.  The occasion was the dance at Bath
which was to prove so momentous an event in
Catherine's life.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"What gown and what head-dress she should
wear on the occasion became her chief concern.
She cannot be justified in it.  Dress is at all times
a frivolous distinction, and excessive solicitude
about it often destroys its own aim.  Catherine
knew all this very well; her great-aunt had read
her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas
before; and yet she lay awake ten minutes on
Wednesday night debating between her spotted
and her tamboured muslin; and nothing but the
shortness of the time prevented her buying a new
one for the evening.  This would have been an
error in judgment, great though not uncommon,
from which one of the other sex rather than her
own, a brother rather than a great-aunt, might
have warned her; for man only can be aware of
the insensibility of man towards a new gown.  It
would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies
could they be made to understand how little the
heart of man is affected by what is costly or new
in their attire; how little it is biassed by the texture
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
of their muslin, and how unsusceptible of peculiar
tenderness towards the spotted, the sprigged, the
mull, or the jackonet.  Woman is fine for her own
satisfaction alone.  No man will admire her the
more, no woman will like her the better, for it.
Neatness and fashion are enough for the former,
and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will
be most endearing to the latter."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
If we regard these as the author's considered
opinions, expressed with a characteristic touch of
<i>malice</i>, we shall probably agree that she is, on the
whole, right.  Were women to make a note, every
time a man describes one of them as "well
dressed," of what the subject of the remark was
wearing, they would, I believe, find an
overwhelming preponderance of votes in favour of
well-fitting, plain, if not actually "tailor-made"
costumes for the daytime, and simple though not
conventual frocks for the evening, as compared
with all the highly decorated "confections,"
covered with what one may call "applied art,"
whereon women spend so large a proportion of
their allowances.
</p>

<p>
The letters to Cassandra make up to some
extent for the deficiencies of the novels in a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
matter so attractive to the author's admirers
among her own sex, though the particulars given
are almost always incomplete; that is to say, they
depend on information which Cassandra possessed,
but which is denied to us.  Such a case is
presented when we read: "Elizabeth has given
me a hat, and it is not only a pretty hat, but a
pretty <i>style</i> of hat too.  It is something like
Eliza's, only, instead of being all straw, half of it
is narrow purple ribbon.  I flatter myself, however,
that you can understand very little of it from
this description.  Heaven forbid that I should
ever offer such encouragement to explanations as
to give a clear one on any occasion myself!  But
I must write no more of this."  The tantalizing
thing is that while we know that this pretty hat
was something like Eliza's, we have no idea what
Eliza's was like, beyond the untrimmed fact that
it was "all straw."
</p>

<p>
Then Cassandra is told by Jane, "I believe I
<i>shall</i> make my new gown like my robe, but the
back of the latter is all in a piece with the tail, and
will seven yards enable me to copy it in that
respect?"  Alas! that we cannot discover how the
robe was made, except that "the back was all in a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
piece with the tail."  Often, of course, the news
about dress is mixed up with other news, as when
Jane writes: "At Nackington ... Miss Fletcher
and I were very thick, but I am the thinnest of
the two.  She wore her purple muslin, which is
pretty enough, though it does not become her
complexion...."  Once Jane's account of her own
necessities in the way of dress is nearly followed
by a sentence which not only contains evidence of
her close acquaintance with Fielding's greatest
novel, but also reminds us of Mr. Tom Lefroy.
"You say nothing of the silk stockings; I flatter
myself, therefore, that Charles has not purchased
any, as I cannot very well afford to pay for them;
all my money is spent in buying white gloves and
pink persian....  After I had written the above,
we received a visit from Mr. Tom Lefroy and his
cousin George.  The latter is really very
well-behaved now; and as for the other, he has but <i>one</i>
fault, which time will, I trust, entirely remove&mdash;it
is that his morning coat is a great deal too light.
He is a very great admirer of Tom Jones, and
therefore wears the same coloured clothes, I
imagine, which <i>he</i> did when he was wounded."
</p>

<p>
Many of her references to dress are of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
partly serious, partly humorous kind which came
naturally from her pen.  "Flowers are very much
worn," she writes from Bath in the summer of
1799, "and fruit is still more the thing.  Elizabeth
has a bunch of strawberries and I have seen
grapes, cherries, plums, apricots.  There are
likewise almonds and raisins, French plums, and
tamarinds at the grocers', but I have never seen
any of them in hats."  She had, in the Southampton
days, a spotted muslin which she meant to
wear out, in spite of its durability.  "You will
exclaim at this, but mine really has signs of
feebleness, which, with a little care, may come to
something."  Then she has some "bombazins" with
trains, which "I cannot reconcile myself to giving
up as morning gowns; they are so very sweet by
candlelight.  I would rather sacrifice my blue one
... in short I do not know and I do not care."
</p>

<p>
A peep into the economy of Steventon parsonage
is now and again offered.  In 1796, "We are
very busy making Edward's shirts, and I am
proud to say that I am the neatest worker of the
party.  They say that there are a prodigious
number of birds hereabouts this year, so that
perhaps <i>I</i> may kill a few."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
</p>

<p>
Another bit of work that the want of the riches
of Kent forced upon the poorer folks of Hampshire
is shown to us when Jane writes: "I bought
some Japan ink and next week shall begin my
operations on my hat, on which you know my
principal hopes of happiness depend."  In this
case there is no difficulty of interpretation.
Now-a-days there are simple "dips" wherewith young
ladies whose allowances are small or who in any
case wish to make the most of their money can
change old straw hats into new, soiled white into
black, or green, or heliotrope.  It was not so a
century ago, and when Jane wanted to turn her
old white straw hat into a new black one, she must
needs Japan it.
</p>

<p>
"I have read the 'Corsair,' mended my petticoat,
and have nothing else to do," she writes from
London in 1814, and on another day about the
same time she informs her sister: "I have
determined to trim my lilac sarsenet with black
satin ribbon, just as my China crape is,
six-penny width at the bottom, threepenny or
four-penny at top."  An even closer glimpse of Jane
in her home is afforded by a letter in which she
says&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P216"></a>216}</span>
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I find great comfort in my stuff gown, but I
hope you do not wear yours too often.  I have
made myself two or three caps to wear of evenings
since I came home, and they save me a world of
torment as to hair-dressing, which at present gives
me no trouble beyond washing and brushing, for
my long hair is always plaited up out of sight,
and my short hair curls well enough to want no
papering."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Such references may remind us of Henry Tilney's
astonishment that Catherine did not keep a
journal of her doings.  "How are your absent
cousins to understand the tenor of your life...?
How are your various dresses to be remembered,
and the particular state of your complexion and
curl of your hair to be described, in all their
diversities, without having constant recourse to a
journal?  My dear madam, I am not so ignorant
of young ladies' ways as you wish to believe me."
</p>

<p>
Jane Austen was not reduced, as was her own
Mrs. Hurst, to playing with her bracelets and rings
when there were no games or dances in progress.
On such occasions, like Elizabeth Bennet, she
took up some needlework, and amused herself by
listening to the general conversation, and entering
into it when opportunity offered.  Like everything
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
done by her deft fingers, her fancy sewing is
admirable, and her embroidery would be treasured
by her family for its intrinsic beauty even if no
such charming associations attached to it.  There
is a muslin scarf adorned by her needle which, to
her true lovers, might seem a more precious relic
than even her mahogany desk itself.
</p>

<p>
One little "interior" sketched by Jane, after a
visit to a young wife who had just been blessed
with a baby, is so illustrative of her own neat
habits, and her ideas of the material needs of
happiness, that, intimate as it is, it merits
quotation: "Mary does not manage matters in such a
way as to make me want to lay in myself.  She is
not tidy enough in her appearance; she has no
dressing-gown to sit up in; her curtains are all too
thin, and things are not in that comfort and style
about her which are necessary to make such a
situation an enviable one."
</p>

<p>
We have seen on an earlier page that Jane
Austen provided warm garments for the village
poor.  On one occasion we know where she bought
her flannel.  In an entry (made at Basingstoke)
which might form the text for a dissertation on
prejudice and economy, she notes that: "I gave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> a yard for my flannel, and I fancy it is
not very good, but it is so disgraceful and
contemptible an article in itself that its being
comparatively good or bad is of little importance."  Why
this contempt for what, in spite of all
patent substitutes, inflammable and otherwise, is
still commonly esteemed one of the most harmless
and necessary of materials?  Marianne Dashwood
included the wearing of a flannel waistcoat by
Colonel Brandon among the several defects which
made it impossible that she should ever be his
wife, and when, for reasons not all unconnected
with the "happy ending" of the novel, she agreed
at last to marry him, it was in spite of the fact that
this gallant officer had "sought the constitutional
safeguard" of the much-despised garment.  To
Jane Austen and Marianne Dashwood flannel, it
seems, was as entirely unpleasing a commodity as
celluloid collars and cuffs are to most people of
our own day.
</p>

<p>
The ravages of consumption, as the Baron de
Frenilly reflects in his recently published memoirs,
would have been far less terrible in those times if
women had been less hostile to warm dresses and
flannel petticoats.  Fresh air and thick boots were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
also to seek.  The women could not walk ten
yards on a wet day without the water coming
through the thin soles of their dainty little shoes.
Miss Bates was quite exceptional in wearing shoes
with reasonable soles.
</p>

<p>
One more sumptuary extract must be quoted;
it comes from a letter from London in 1814: "My
poor old muslin has never been dyed yet.  It has
been promised to be done several times.  What
wicked people dyers are.  They begin with
dipping their own souls in scarlet sin."  The last
sentence brings its writer for the moment very
near to modern fiction, a considerable proportion
of which is mainly occupied with the vivid
representation of the process in question as applied to
the world in general.
</p>

<p>
After clothes, the table.  Out of the works of
some novelists you might draw up menus, or at
least bills-of-fare, for a month.  People who dwell
in a bracing air, and take a great deal of exercise,
could live very comfortably on a small selection
from the dishes served up in the novels of
Dickens, and those who like an even more simple
cuisine could rely quite confidently on the meals
described by Dumas <i>père</i>.  There is plenty of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
substantial fare, of course, in the Waverley novels,
and as for the works of Harrison Ainsworth, they
groan under the sirloins and haunches that were
provided in those imaginary ages when in Merry
England the spits were always turning in every
castle and hall.  The people of Jane Austen ate
quite as much as was good for them.  They had
breakfast, lunch&mdash;or noonshine&mdash;dinner, supper,
and tea, and everybody&mdash;always excepting
Mr. Woodhouse and those whose spirits were
temporarily depressed&mdash;came with an appetite to
every meal, for all we know of the matter.  No
dinner is particularly described, but those who
want to know what people ate and drank at the
end of the eighteenth century may partly gratify
their appetite from the references which inevitably
occur.  Except that there were not quite so many
dishes on the table at once the meals differed little
from that to which Swift introduces us in his
dialogue between the company at Lady Smart's
table.  The Smarts, by the way, dined at three,
which in Jane Austen's time was still about the
hour for the small country-houses, though in the
big houses it was five, marking the gradual
advance from the ten o'clock in the morning of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
twelfth century to the eight o'clock in the evening
or later of the twentieth.
</p>

<p>
Plain roast and boiled joints of mutton, pork,
beef and veal, chickens, game in season,
sweetbreads, meat pies, boiled vegetables, suet
puddings, apple-tarts, jellies and custards were the
ordinary food of the well-to-do.  Port and Burgundy
were their principal drinks, but probably the
port was not usually such as is chiefly sold
now-a-days.  It was less fortified, nearer to the natural
wine, which is itself more like a Burgundy than
the port of modern commerce.  Wine of any sort
is scarcely mentioned in Jane Austen's works.  One
of the few exceptions I can recall is that&mdash;of
unnamed species&mdash;offered to Mrs. and Miss Bates
at the Woodhouses', which the host advised them
to mix freely with water, advice they successfully
managed to avoid taking, thanks to the good
offices of Emma.  Jane Austen herself seems to
have been fond of wine.  In her thirty-eighth year
she writes: "As I must leave off being young, I
find many <i>douceurs</i> in being a sort of <i>chaperon</i>,
for I am put on the sofa near the fire, and can
drink as much wine as I like."  On a much earlier
occasion, when she was herself under
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
chaperonage, she had written: "I believe I drank too much
wine last night at Hurstbourne.  I know not how
else to account for the shaking of my hands
to-day.  You will kindly make allowance therefore
for any indistinctness of writing, by attributing it
to this venial error."  With our full knowledge of
Jane's habit of playful exaggeration we may be
certain that her "too much" was nothing to shake
our heads over, and that the "error" was indeed
"venial."
</p>

<p>
Jane gives us sufficient evidence of the
simplicity with which the Austens' own table was
furnished.  From Steventon parsonage, in 1798,
she thus refers to one of the doctor's professional
visits to her mother.  "Mr. Lyford was here
yesterday; he came while we were at dinner, and
partook of our elegant entertainment.  I was not
ashamed at asking him to sit down to table, for
we had some pease-soup, a sparerib, and a
pudding.  He wants my mother to look yellow and to
throw out a rash, but she will do neither."
</p>

<p>
Years later, from Chawton, she writes that:
"Captain Foote dined with us on Friday, and I
fear will not soon venture again, for the strength
of our dinner was a boiled leg of mutton,
underdone even for James."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
</p>

<p>
Jane herself did the housekeeping when her
mother was indisposed and Cassandra away, and
she prided herself on her success, though she
detested the necessity of great economy.  Her
ideas on the eternal servant question are not, we
may be sure, quite faithfully expressed when she
writes: "My mother looks forward with as much
certainty as you can do to our keeping two maids;
my father is the only one not in the secret.  We
plan having a steady cook and a young, giddy
housemaid, with a sedate, middle-aged man, who
is to undertake the double office of husband to the
former, and sweetheart to the latter.  No children,
of course, to be allowed on either side."  The
simple life of the parsonage is more accurately
reflected in a comparison between the house of the
Austens and that of the Knights at Godmersham.
"We dine now at half-past three, and have done
dinner, I suppose, before you begin.  We drink
tea at half-past six.  I am afraid you will despise
us.  My father reads Cowper to us in the morning,
to which I listen when I can.  How do you spend
your evenings?  I guess that Elizabeth works,
that you read to her, and that Edward goes to
sleep."  Jane declares that she "always takes care
to provide such things as please (her) own
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
appetite," which she considers "the chief merit
in housekeeping."  Ragout of veal and haricot
mutton seem to have been specially attractive to
her.
</p>

<p>
Picnics we hear of&mdash;one in particular, of course,
at Box Hill&mdash;and the Middletons were always
getting them up.  Cold pies and cold chickens,
and no doubt cold punch, were provided in plenty
on those happy occasions.
</p>

<p>
French cookery was not so much appreciated
in England in those days as it had been twenty or
thirty years earlier, before the Revolution.  The
bread of our then hostile neighbours across the
Channel was, however, not infrequently copied in
the bakehouse, as was the Boulanger dance in the
ball-room.  Mrs. Morland reproached Catherine
for talking so much at breakfast about the French
bread at Northanger, but the poor little girl who
had been so shamefully treated by General Tilney,
and sadly missed the attentions of his younger
son, replied that she did not care about the
bread, and it was all the same to her what she
ate.  Mrs. Morland could only attribute the
girl's obvious unhappiness to the contrast afforded
by their humble parsonage to the glories of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
the Tilney mansion, "There is a very clever
essay in one of the books up-stairs, upon much
such a subject," says this anxious mother, "about
young girls that have been spoilt for home by
great acquaintance&mdash;<i>The Mirror</i>, I think.  I will
look it out for you some day or other, because I
am sure it will do you good."  Catherine tried to
be cheerful, but presently relapsed into languor
and weariness; and Mrs. Morland went off to seek
for the "very clever essay."  As Henry Tilney
arrived before she returned with it, its efficacy as
a prophylactic for listlessness and discontent was
never put to the test.  I will take the risk of
inducing the "listlessness and discontent" of the
present reader by devoting a page to this moral
souvenir of Jane Austen's infancy and of her own
literary diversions.

The "very clever essay" is dated March 6,
1779, and is in the form of a letter from John
Homespun, a "plain country gentleman, with a
small fortune and a large family," two of whose
daughters had been allowed&mdash;his opposition
having been overcome&mdash;to spend the Christmas
holidays with a "great lady" whom they had met at
the house of a relation.  They went with sparkling
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
eyes and rosy cheeks, they came back with
"cheeks as white as a curd, and eyes as dead as
the beads in the face of a baby."  Their father
sees no reason to wonder at the change when he
hears the girls, with new-found affectations of
speech and manner, describe the habits of their
new friends.

"Instead of rising at seven, breakfasting at
nine, dining at three, supping at eight, and getting
to bed by ten, as was their custom at home, my
girls lay till twelve, breakfasted at one, dined at
six, supped at eleven, and were never in bed till
three in the morning.  Their shapes had undergone
as much alteration as their faces.  From
their bosoms (<i>necks</i> they called them), which
were squeezed up to their throats, their waists
tapered down to a very extraordinary smallness;
they resembled the upper half of an hour-glass.
At this, also, I marvelled; but it was the only
shape worn at &mdash;&mdash;.  Nor is their behaviour less
changed than their garb.  Instead of joining in
the good-humoured cheerfulness we used to have
among us before, my two <i>fine</i> young ladies check
every approach to mirth, by calling it <i>vulgar</i>.  One
of them chid their brother the other day for
laughing, and told him it was monstrously ill-bred....
Would you believe it, sir, my daughter <i>Elizabeth</i>
(since her visit she is offended if we call her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
<i>Betty</i>) said it was <i>fanatical</i> to find fault with
card-playing on Sunday; and her sister <i>Sophia</i> gravely
asked my son-in-law, the clergyman, if he had not
some doubts of the soul's immortality?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mr. Homespun declares that the moral plague
among the worldly rich should be dealt with by
Government "as much as the distemper among
the <i>horned cattle</i>."
</p>

<p>
Happily Catherine Morland had not caught this
particular disease of all&mdash;it was only the plague
of love that troubled her innocent soul, and the
medicine was provided without the interference of
a Government inspector.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
From such a deliberate departure from the
straight path I come back to the subject of the
economy of accessories in Jane Austen's novels.
When the French bread at Northanger led me
astray, I was writing about domestic economy,
costumes and cookery.  Why <i>should</i> the dresses
be described or the dishes be named?  We are
concerned with the sayings and doings of squires
and parsons and their wives and daughters, not
with the achievements of cooks and milliners.
This would be quite a fair criticism, but it is none
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
the less certain that an author who tells you what
people eat and drink and wear does enable you to
realize more fully the contrast between the present
and the period with which the novel is concerned.
That is our business, however, not his.  He is an
artist, not an historian.  There is a common
practice on the stage of "furbishing up" old plays by
cutting out obsolete references and introducing
topical touches.  The comedies of Robertson may
be "freshened" considerably to meet the taste of
thoughtless play-goers, by giving Captain
Hawtrey a motor-car and Jack Poyntz a
magazine-rifle.  The "moral" of these present pages is
merely this, that with a few such slight changes
as making post-chaise read motor and coach read
train, and retarding the dinner from three or five
to eight or half-past, cutting out the occasional
"elegants," and otherwise changing a word here
and there in the dialogue, long scenes from
any one of Jane Austen's novels could be acted
without material alteration, in the costume of
to-day, with no serious offence to the unities.  The
absence of physical detail in her narrative is no
artistic defect.  Mr. Collins's first evening at
Longbourn, for instance, is so vividly represented that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
we gain the impression of having been in the room,
though of its size and shape, and furniture, or of
the appearance and costume of its occupants, we
are told little or nothing&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully
answered.  His cousin was as absurd as he had
hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest
enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the
most resolute composure of countenance, and
except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth,
requiring no partner in his pleasure.
</p>

<p class="quote">
"By tea-time, however, the dose had been
enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his
guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea
was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the
ladies.  Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book
was produced; but on beholding it (for
everything announced it to be from a circulating
library), he started back, and begging pardon,
protested that he never read novels.  Kitty stared
at him, and Lydia exclaimed.  Other books were
produced, and after some deliberation he chose
<i>Fordyce's Sermons</i>.  Lydia gaped as he opened
the volume, and before he had, with very
monotonous solemnity, read three pages she interrupted
him with&mdash;

<p class="quote">
"'Do you know, mamma, that my Uncle Phillips
talks of turning away Richard; and if he does,
Colonel Forster will hire him?  My aunt told me
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
so herself on Saturday.  I shall walk to Meryton
to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when
Mr. Denny comes back from town.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold
her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid
aside his book, and said&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
"'I have often observed how little young ladies
are interested by books of a serious stamp, though
written solely for their benefit.  It amazes me, I
confess; for certainly, there can be nothing so
advantageous to them as instruction.  But I will
no longer importune my young cousin.'
</p>

<p class="quote">
"Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself
as his antagonist at backgammon.  Mr. Bennet
accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling
amusements."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The mephistophelian delight of the father in
the unconscious absurdity of his sententious guest,
the rudeness of the younger daughters, and the
attempts of the elder girls to enforce the
observance of ordinary good manners, could not well be
realized with finer effect, and no description of
accessories would heighten it.
</p>

<p>
It is not only material accessories and necessaries,
furniture, dress, and so on that are slighted
by Jane Austen.  Incidents that are of positive
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
value to her plan are not allowed to linger a
moment after they have served the turn.  The
adventure of Harriet Smith (in <i>Emma</i>) with the
gipsies, ending in her rescue by Frank Churchill,
fills just half a page.  It would have filled a
chapter in a novel by Scott or Dickens.  One possible
reason for this brevity is clear enough.  The
author knew little about gipsies, they were to her
merely low ruffians and drabs, horse-stealers and
pilferers, and of their fascination for the student
of character she had no idea at all.  There were
hundreds and hundreds of genuine Romany about
the country in those days.  Borrow was not yet at
work, and few people had taken the trouble to
discover what manner of mind the "Egyptians"
possessed, and how they spent their time when
they were not robbing henroosts or swindling
housemaids.  Scott felt something of the mysterious
charm of this ancient and nomadic race, but he
was romantic, and romance, in Jane Austen's way
of thinking, was very nearly a synonym for
absurdity.  So it is, therefore, that the gipsies in
the Highbury lane appear for half a page, speak
no word that is reported, and then vanish from
our ken.  The author implies that they hurried
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
away to avoid prosecution.  Perhaps she was
almost as glad to see the last of them as were the
inhabitants of Highbury.  Thus is a fine
opportunity for a "picturesque" scene thrown away.
Undeveloped as it is, the adventure stands
absolutely alone in the novels as the sole occasion
whereon any of the characters has reason to fear
violence at the hands of ill-disposed persons.  It
was only in imagination that Catherine Morland
was carried off by masked men, though a spirited
illustration of Mr. Hugh Thomson's did once
mislead a too hurried critic into regarding the
affair as an event in the heroine's life.
</p>

<p>
There are, in fact, very few digressions in
these books.  Fielding "digressed" by whole
chapters at a time, Sterne's digressions filled more
space than his tale in his one "novel."  Jane
Austen keeps to the road, and leaves the by-lanes
unexplored.  It is a pleasant road, old, and
bordered here and there with attractive-looking
houses into which we may enter by her kindly
introduction, but if we wish to go off to that
hamlet on the right, or that coppice on the left,
we must go alone.  She will sit on a stile till we
return to pursue the direct route.  It is to her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P233"></a>233}</span>
effort to avoid all but the essential factors in
achieving her object that the general absence of
landscape and topographical detail of all kinds
in her work is to be attributed.  In the case of a
Dickens, a Balzac, a Hardy or a Meredith, you
can constantly identify the places where the scenes
are laid.  In Lincoln's Inn Fields you can watch
Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows; at Rochester you
can see the very room where Mr. Pickwick slept;
at Nemours you can gaze at the house where The
Minoret-Levraults (in <i>Ursule Mirouet</i>) lived; at
Woolbridge you can find the manor house where
the unhappy Tess passed her bridal night.  Down
in Surrey you can take a photograph of the
Crossways House which was almost the whole fortune
of Diana, at Seaford you can see the "Elba
Hall" of <i>The House on the Beach</i> sheltering
beneath the downs, and as in these instances so
in scores of others.  But in connection with the
Austen novels, save for the London streets and
squares, there are only Bath and Lyme Regis and
Portsmouth where one can truly feel sure that
such or such an incident in one or other novel
"occurred" on this very spot.
</p>

<p>
If, however, there is no special "Jane Austen
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
country" to be traced out by the diligent seeker
for visible associations, there are scattered spots
where her presence is still to be felt.  At
Steventon, where the earlier works were produced, the
house of the Austens no longer stands, having
given place long since to a rectory on the other
side of the valley, more convenient and
comfortable than that wherein the father wrote his
sermons and the daughter her novels&mdash;sermons
and novels which at the time seemed equally
likely to achieve enduring fame.  Only the well
and the pump remain to mark the site.  The
surroundings are not all new&mdash;how should they be
in a thinly populated parish?  There are still
farms and cottages that were old before Jane was
born.  The church is in better trim, but, externally
at least, it is much the same.
</p>

<p>
Probably with scenery as with men and women
Jane Austen did not usually draw from models,
and when she did, she gave the models their
own names.  The one real bit of description of
a place named in her work is the account of
the environs of Lyme Regis, which is so obviously
written from personal interest that some of her
biographers have supposed that her own
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
experiences during her visits there had included a
Captain Wentworth or at least a Captain Benwick.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"A very strange stranger it must be," she
writes, "who does not see charms in the immediate
environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it
better.  The scenes in its neighbourhood,
Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps
of country, and still more its sweet retired bay,
backed by dark cliffs, where fragments of low
rock among the sands make it the happiest spot
for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in
unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of
the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all,
Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic
rocks, where the scattered forest trees and
orchards of luxuriant growth declare that many
a generation must have passed away since the first
partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for
such a state, where a scene so wonderful and so
lovely is exhibited, as may more than equal any
of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of
Wight&mdash;these places must be visited, and visited
again, to make the worth of Lyme understood."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This was quite an exceptional digression from
the thoughts and conversation of Jane Austen's
characters.  One of those letters which Leslie
Stephen and others have thought so "trivial," but
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
which are so characteristic in their spirit, was
written from Lyme by Jane to Cassandra, on
September 14, 1804&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
"I continue quite well; in proof of which
I have bathed again this morning.....  I
endeavour, as far as I can, to supply your place,
and be useful and keep things in order.  I detect
dirt in the water decanters, as fast as I can,
and keep everything as it was under your
administration....  The ball last night was
pleasant....  Nobody asked me for the two first
dances; the two next I danced with Mr. Crawford,
and had I chosen to stay longer might have
danced with Mr. Granville ... or with a new
odd-looking man who had been eyeing me for
some time, and at last, without any introduction,
asked me if I meant to dance again."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is impossible to leave Lyme Regis without
recalling how Tennyson, when he was shown the
place where the Duke of Monmouth was supposed
to have landed, cried: "Don't talk to me
of the Duke of Monmouth!  Show me the exact
spot where Louisa Musgrove fell!"
</p>

<p>
Jane's intimacy with places was chiefly confined
to Steventon, Godmersham, Chawton, Southampton,
Bath, and their neighbourhood.  It is not a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P237"></a>237}</span>
day's walk or an hour's motoring from Steventon
to Chawton, where, after the long interval
of comparative inactivity, the later novels were
"born."  At Chawton, according to one of her
later biographers, the "cottage" where she lived
and worked has disappeared.  This is happily
not true.  It is true that it is now turned to
other uses than that of sheltering a parson's
widow and her daughters.  It has been divided
internally, and now forms a couple of labourers'
cottages and a village club, where tired toilers
who have never read a line of the books that were
written under that roof discuss the merits and
defects of the tobacco tax and the Old Age
Pensions Act.  Chawton House itself shows little
structural change, and the park is scarcely altered
since Jane walked across from the Cottage to take
tea with her relations at the great house.
</p>

<p>
At either of these villages, Steventon the
birthplace of Jane herself and of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>
and <i>Mansfield Park</i>, and Chawton where <i>Persuasion</i>
and <i>Emma</i> came into being, you may find
scenes which you will associate with this or that
story or incident, but nowhere are you likely to
feel the influence of locality more strongly in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
connection with either author or novels than at
Godmersham, the home of her brother Edward,
where, until long after her death, her relations
dwelt amid their own broad acres.  The place,
with other property, came to Edward Austen
from Mr. and Mrs. Knight, who had adopted him,
and whose name he ultimately took.  There is no
more typically English seat in the typically
English county of Kent.  The small sylvan village,
the old church above the Stour river, offer no
special attractions for tourists, and Godmersham
House itself is one of the plainest even among
the country seats of the early Georgian age.  Its
one external charm is its unpretentiousness.  It
has not even the huge classic portico on which so
many of the country houses of its period depend
for "impressiveness."  Plain, commodious,
well-placed, the house is lovely for us only in that it
sheltered for many a week, from year to year, the
author of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.  It is just such a
house as Sir John Middleton filled with visitors
at all seasons, or Mr. Darcy showed to his future
bride and her Uncle and Aunt Gardiner.
</p>

<p>
If the house itself is without external beauty,
the park surrounding it is delightful.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
sparkling river flows through the midst of great
elms and oaks beneath which mingled herds
of deer, sheep, and oxen browse in the peaceful
security of the golden age.  As you sit on
the low wall of the lichen-covered bridge you
see nothing that can have changed in character
since Jane Austen sat there and thought over
the doings of her dear heroines.  One can
almost hear the rumble of the barouche that
brought her mother and herself from the coach
at Ashford to the Hall at Godmersham, and if
that high-hung carriage were suddenly to turn
the corner beside the big elm near the gate one
would scarcely be astonished.  This park and this
house, this river, the old trees, the thatched
cottages, the lanes and brooks all speak of the days
when Bingley came for Jane Bennet, and Henry
Tilney for Catherine Morland.  If there is
anything in the influence of place, Godmersham was
part author of the novels.  The spirit of Jane
Austen abides in the delicious air of this quiet and
unspoilt valley, where, when the wind blows
strongly from the south-east, the salt of the
sea-breeze mingles with the perfumes of the grass and
the wood smoke as pleasantly as the Attic wit of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
Jane Austen mingles with the sweetness of her
heroines and the thousand delights of her
dialogue.
</p>

<p>
These are the chief country scenes of Jane's
life.  As to the towns, we know more or less of
her associations with Bath, Southampton, and
Winchester, as well as London.  At Bath she
used to stay in early youth with her uncle and
aunt, and she lived there for four years with her
parents.  The fruits of her experience there may
be enjoyed in <i>Northanger Abbey</i> and <i>Persuasion</i>,
though her lack of the topographical instinct is
suggested by the absence of evident interest in
the buildings of Bath.  We learn as much about
the place from the <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, which merely
touch there on their way, or from the allusions of
the characters in <i>The Rivals</i>, where the events are
of a few days, as we do from chapters that cover
long periods of residence in one of the most
beautiful, and still, in spite of the disproportionate
and architecturally discordant hotel, the least
injured cities of England.  Souvenirs of the
personal association of Jane Austen with Bath are
almost as plentiful as those of Johnson with Fleet
Street.  The house in Sydney Place where the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
Austens lived during most of the time between
Mr. Austen's resignation and his death is the only
one that bears a tablet to Jane's memory.  But
in Queen Square, whence several of her letters
are dated, in Gay Street, in the Green Park, in
the Paragon, the rooms she occupied with her
relations at one time or another remain very much
as they were in her day, and externally the
buildings are unaltered, one and all being built
of the local stone which gives so notable a
character to the Georgian architecture of the city.
In Camden Place where the Elliots rented "the
best house," in Pulteney Street where Catherine
stayed with the Allens, in Westgate Buildings
where Anne cheered Mrs. Smith's lonely days,
there has been little change since <i>Northanger
Abbey</i> and <i>Persuasion</i> were written.  There is
probably no town in the world associated with the
work of a famous person of even so near a period
which has altered less in appearance than Bath
since 1805.
</p>

<p>
At Southampton the mother and daughters
lived, after the father's death, in a house in that
secluded part of the town which stands between
the High Street and the old walls above the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
"Water."  There is a bit of those walls which
abuts on the spot where the Austens' house stood,
and it is one of the places where we may feel
confident that we are walking where Jane often
walked, and gazing out over a scene which was
familiar to her in almost all save the funnels of
the steam yachts and the distant view of the train
on its way to Bournemouth or to London.
</p>

<p>
In London itself there are many spots that
will always recall Jane Austen to her devoted
friends and her lovers.  In Henrietta Street
(Covent Garden), in Hans Place, in Cork Street,
we know that she herself stayed.  Many of the
characters in <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>&mdash;the only
novel in which we hear much of London&mdash;are
associated with familiar streets.  Edward Ferrars
stayed in Pall Mall, the Steele girls in Bartlett's
Buildings, Mrs. Jennings in Berkeley Street, the
John Dashwoods in Harley Street.  The Gardiners
(<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>) lived in Gracechurch
Street.
</p>

<p>
The day has not yet come when public bodies
could be sufficiently affected by imaginative
literature to place memorials on the houses where
fictitious personages have been supposed to dwell.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
In Paris the memorial to Charlet is an admirable
group of a grenadier and a gamin&mdash;typical
characters from his work, and a musketeer guards
the monument of Dumas.  The gods forbid that
any sculptor should be commissioned to give us
life-size figures of Emma, Elizabeth, Anne, and
Fanny to sit around a statue of Jane Austen.
But when next the London County Council
contemplates the placing of plaques on the former
residences of departed worthies they might
consider whether&mdash;of course with the consent of the
freeholder and the leaseholder&mdash;her name might
not be placed on the house in Henrietta Street,
once her brother Henry's home, where so many of
her letters were written.  She tells of the
convenient arrangement of its rooms for the comfort
of herself and her nieces, and from its door she
went to the neighbouring church, or the theatres,
which were within a few minutes' walk.  It is not
likely that any political prejudice would cause
even the most advanced Progressive on the
Council to object to the name of so very mild a
Tory being thus honoured.  As to the more probable
objection that she did not "reside" there, but
was only a visitor, one may plead that as there is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
a plaque on a newly-erected tube station recalling
the "residence" of Mrs. Siddons, and that a tablet
proclaims that Turner "lived" in a house built
thirty years after his death, there would be no
great straining of logic in admitting the claim of a
house in which Jane Austen did undoubtedly
write, and sleep, and talk.  The front was
cemented in the middle of the last century, and
the ground-floor is now used for business
purposes, but otherwise the house is little changed
since the Austens were there.

<h3>
VII
<br />
INFLUENCE IN LITERATURE
</h3>

<p class="intro">
Jane Austen's genius ignored&mdash;Negative and positive
instances&mdash;The literary orchard&mdash;Jane's influence in
English literature.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The author of a book bearing the title <i>Great English
Novelists</i>, published just ninety-one years after
Jane Austen's death, does not include her in his
selection.  He deals with eleven authors&mdash;Defoe,
Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, Scott,
Lytton, Disraeli, Dickens, Thackeray, Meredith.
The very fact that he stops short at eleven,
instead of making a round dozen, suggests that he
really could not think of any other novelist worthy
to be credited with greatness.  It will be observed
that all the team are men.  Without quibbling as
to whether they are all "English," or all "great,"
or even all "novelists" in the ordinary sense of
the word, we may legitimately suppose that the
author is one of those to whom Jane Austen makes
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P248"></a>248}</span>
no strong appeal.  The peculiarity of her position
among English novelists could not well be more
pointedly emphasized than in the fact that while
Macaulay placed her next to Shakespeare as a
painter of character-studies, a critic should be
found&mdash;and he is by no means isolated&mdash;who can
choose eleven great representatives of English
fiction without adding her as a twelfth.  In the
same week in which the book just referred to was
published, came a portfolio of twelve photogravures
entitled <i>Britain's Great Authors</i>.  Scott,
Thackeray, Dickens, of course, were among them,
and of right, but not Jane Austen.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps even more suggestive is the statement
of a clever woman-writer the other day that Jane
Austen's novels are merely "memorials," books
which no gentleman's (or lady's) library should be
without, but which are for show rather than for use.
</p>

<p>
Her name may never be among those that are
painted round the reading-rooms of National
Libraries, nor included by many school-children
in examination lists of eminent authors.  Hers is
too delicate a product to attract the man or woman
"in the street."  There is a bouquet about it that
is lost on the palate which enjoys the "strong"
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P249"></a>249}</span>
fiction of the material phase through which
humanity is now passing&mdash;passing perhaps more
briefly than most of us imagine.
</p>

<p>
It has been the endeavour of this book to show
Jane Austen as she lives in her writings, and to
suggest some at least of the many directions in
which those writings may be explored, and thus,
if so may be, to bring new members into the
large but comparatively restricted circle wherein
she is regarded, not always as the first of English
novelists, but at least as second to none in the
quality of her work.  Sappho enjoys undying fame
with only a few fragments of verse still to her
credit, Omar for his one poem transformed by
another mind, Boccaccio for a volume of short
stories, Boswell for one biography, Thomas à
Kempis for one devotional manual.  Sparsity of
performance, it is evident, is no bar to enduring
fame.  Jane Austen's work, indeed, was not sparse.
There are, undoubtedly, novelists who have passed
the record of Balzac with his forty novels and
scores of short stories, but their books for the most
part suggest the interminable succession of poplars
along so many a high road of France.  Some of
the trees have more foliage than others, some are
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P250"></a>250}</span>
more green or more blue in tone, a little more
tortuous, or robust, but in spite of all trivial
differences <i>plus ça change plus c'est la même chose</i>.
If this arboreal parallel may be pursued, may we
not compare the work of Jane Austen with a group
of apple-trees in a sunny corner of some vast
orchard?  There are eight Austen trees in the
literary orchard.  Two of them are stunted and
bear a poor crop of a sort little better than
crabapples.  The other six are of several kinds, but
all of fine quality and producing delicious fruit of
varying sweetness.  Countless thousands of novels
have been published since Jane Austen's were
given to the world, and many of them have been
unseemly, and of evil influence.  But the taste of
countless writers and readers has been sweetened
by the fruit of her delightful mind, of the
passing of whose fragrant harvest through English
literature it is not too much to say, as Jane
herself said of Anne Elliot's walk through Bath:
"It was almost enough to spread purification and
perfume all the way."

1811.  <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>.  [Completed in 1798.
Commenced many years earlier in the form of
letters, under the title <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>.]
</p>

<p class="biblio">
1813.  <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.  [Completed in 1797.
Originally entitled (in MS.) <i>First Impressions</i>.]
</p>

<p class="biblio">
1814.  <i>Mansfield Park</i>.  [Written in 1811-14.]
</p>

<p class="biblio">
1816.  <i>Emma</i>.  [Written in 1811-16.]
</p>

<p class="biblio">
1818.  <i>Northanger Abbey</i> and <i>Persuasion</i>.  [<i>Northanger
Abbey</i> (mostly written in 1798) was sold to a
Bath bookseller for £10 in 1803.  He laid it
aside, and it was bought back by Henry Austen,
<i>at the same price</i>, after <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>
and <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> had appeared.
<i>Persuasion</i>, as originally completed (in 1816) had
only eleven chapters, but the author was not
satisfied with Chapter X, and replaced it by the
present Chapters X and XI.  The cancelled
chapter is included in Mr. Austen Leigh's
memoir.  It brings about the re-engagement of
Anne and Wentworth in a different, and certainly
less admirable, manner.]

<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P252"></a>252}</span>

<p class="biblio">
1871.  <i>Lady Susan</i>, <i>The Watsons</i>, and some extracts from
the novel on which Jane was at work until four
months before her death.  [These are all
included in Mr. Austen Leigh's book.  The
MS. of <i>Lady Susan</i>, written before Jane was of age,
was given by Cassandra Austen to her niece
Fanny (Lady Knatchbull), who consented to its
publication.  As for the incomplete novel known
as <i>The Watsons</i>, written about 1802, Jane was
not responsible for the naming of it, and had
laid it aside several years before <i>Mansfield Park</i>
was written.  The work from which she was
compelled by illness to cease in March 1817 had
not, in the twelve chapters we possess, reached a
point when its plan could be foretold with
reasonable confidence.]
</p>

<p class="biblio">
1884.  <i>Letters of Jane Austen</i>, edited by her great-nephew,
the first Lord Brabourne.  [These, which, with
few exceptions were addressed to Cassandra
Austen, belonged to Lady Knatchbull, to whom
some of them were written.  Many of Jane's
letters were destroyed by Cassandra as being too
private to pass into other hands.]
</p>

<p class="biblio">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. J. E. Austen Leigh's <i>Memoir</i> of his aunt is
not only to be highly valued for its biographical
details, but for its many anecdotes of Jane
Austen, and for the letters which fill a good
many gaps in the other published correspondence.

Produced by Al Haines
Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
